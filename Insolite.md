# Les fails de l'exploration spatiale 

- On November 11, 1982, an over-the-air software update was broadcast to the Viking 1 lander to correct a battery charging issue. The update had an error in it and accidentally overwrote the wrong bits resulting in a bricked lander. Basically, they accidentally overwrote the memory reserved for the antenna pointing code which immediately terminated all communications.  Une erreur humaine durant la mise à jour du logiciel de Viking 1 rend l'antenne de communication HS, et met fin à la mission. I always get nervous updating firmware, but I can't imagine what it would be like to be responsible for ending a billion-dollar mission ($4 billion in 2014 dollars)
- Mars 3 est une sonde spatiale soviétique lancée le 28 mai 1971. L'atterrisseur de Mars 3 est le premier engin de fabrication humaine à avoir réussi à se poser en douceur sur Mars.  Mais vingt secondes seulement après avoir déployé ses instruments, il est victime d'une panne lui donnant juste le temps de transmettre une image sombre et floue de la planète, et l'empêchant ainsi de fournir des informations scientifiques
- Le sismomètre embarqué à bord de Viking 1 reste inopérant car les opérateurs ne parviennent pas à débloquer le verrou qui protège sa partie mobile des vibrations durant le vol : ce sismomètre sera le seul instrument non opérationnel de tout le programme Viking. Le sismomètre de Viking 2 peut être activé mais les scientifiques constatent rapidement que les données collectées n'ont rien à voir avec des mouvements sismiques. Solidaire du pont de l'atterrisseur, l'instrument enregistre tous les mouvements mécaniques affectant celui-ci : rotation de l'antenne grand gain orientable, déplacement du bras robotique, fonctionnement du magnétophone et surtout action du vent qui fait vibrer la plateforme. 
- Venera 11  ET 12 ?? (Vénus) :  Les caméras embarquées n'ont pas fonctionné à la suite d'une erreur de conception qui n'a pas permis d'éjecter les obturateurs placés sur les objectifs. Le système d'analyse de la composition du sol a également été victime d'une panne. 
-  Mariner 1, which was launched amidst great fanfare, experienced multiple failures of its guidance system and was intentionally destroyed just 300 seconds after launch. To this day, it remains unclear exactly what caused the problem for Mariner 1, but most accounts suggest that a minute error in its computer code led to the failure. In fact, noted science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke once quipped that Mariner 1 “was wrecked by the most expensive hyphen in history.” 
- Sometimes the biggest of disasters can come from the smallest of mistakes. Never mind the want of a nail, what about a simple screw up between Imperial and Metric?  In 1998, the Mars Climate Orbiter left Earth for the Red Planet aboard a Delta II rocket. Designed to study the martian atmosphere and serve as a communications relay station for other missions, the orbiter had an uneventful launch and journey. But when the probe reached Mars, it began its planned orbital insertion maneuver, went silent, and was never heard from again. An in-depth analysis of Mars Climate Orbiter’s data showed impulse figures that were supposed to be reported to the computer in newton-seconds were actually reported in pound-force seconds, essentially rendering them gibberish. The Mars Climate Orbiter acted on this erroneous information, entered an orbit that was too low, and either burned up in the atmosphere or skipped off it into space. The cost of the mission was $327 million. But at least that expensive lesson taught NASA to better check its units. It turned out that NASA was using metric units to measure the thrust needed to put the orbiter on the right trajectory, but the main contractor Lockheed Martin was using English units in the ground-based computer used to make the calculations. Lockheed calculated the thrust in pound-seconds, but NASA interpreted these as Newton-seconds, so the orbiter came in too low and burned up. 
- L'oeil de Hubble when it was launched in 1990, it was regarded as the ultimate white elephant – not surprising given its project costs have gone from US$400 million to US$10 billion in the past quarter century. Within weeks of launching, images sent back by Hubble made it obvious that there was something seriously wrong with the telescope. The images were good, but not what was expected for the money spent. The telescope simply couldn't focus properly because the primary mirror had been ground to the wrong shape, which introduced spherical aberrations. Since the Hubble was already designed to be serviced by astronauts, NASA developed the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), which was fitted by a Shuttle crew in January 1994.
- When NASA's Genesis mission to collect samples of the solar wind and return them to Earth returned home after three years in space, it seemed like a triumph. Launched on August 8, 2001, it had gone into deep space and used a remarkable aerogel collector to trap particles streaming out from the Sun like flies in amber. At the end of the collection phase, the sampler was folded and sealed into a return capsule, which was set on an intercept course with Earth. On September 8, 2004, the capsule entered the atmosphere over Oregon at a speed of 11 km/s (24,700 mph). Protected by its heat shield, it slowed down to supersonic speed and a parachute deployed to slow it down more. Then, before it touched down, a helicopter snared the capsule in midair and flew off to the recovery base. At least, that was the idea. What really happened was that a faulty deceleration sensor failed to trigger the drogue parachute deployment. Still traveling in free fall at 311 km/h (193 mph), the capsule pranged into the floor of the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah so hard that the capsule cracked open and part of the sample chamber was breached. At first, it seemed like a total loss, but luckily the soft ground cushioned the impact so the capsule didn't disintegrate, and careful recovery work managed to save some of the samples despite the contamination caused by the crash.  But the one thing that truly makes Genesis stand out was the chutzpah displayed by one NASA spokesman on the day of the incident, who said that the mission was a complete success … right up until the crash.
-  Beagle 2. This grassroots little Mars Lander That Could of a mission had a sort of come-from-behind spirit to it that defied failure. Named after the famous ship, HMS Beagle, that carried Charles Darwin around the world in the 1830s, it was the brainchild of Professor Colin Pillinger of Britain's Open University and was developed along with the University of Leicester. The first British interplanetary probe, it was designed to look for signs of present or past life on Mars. In the end, the project managed to raise £44 million (US$80 million) from the private sector and £22 million (US$40 million) from the British government – lunch money compared to other Mars missions. With this, they managed to build a 33.2 kg (73 lb) clam shell spacecraft designed to land either way up on Mars, then deploy a set of four circular solar panels, an arm with a camera, a rock sampler, a spectroscope, and a tethered "mole" rover that would burrow a few feet from the spacecraft before being winched back. On June 2, 2003, Beagle 2 lifted off attached to ESA's Mars Express orbiter. Six days before the orbiter reached Mars, it was released to proceed on its own and entered the Martian atmosphere on a ballistic trajectory at 20,000 km/h (10,800 mph) on December 25. It was never heard from again. For the next twelve years, the world wondered what had happened. After overcoming so many obstacles and beating so many odds, how could Beagle 2 simply vanish? There were questions raised in the British House of Commons, official inquiries were made, and many theories were put forth as to what happened. Meanwhile, Beagle 2's father, Pillinger, passed away in 2014. Then in January of 2015, NASA disclosed that its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had spotted the little lander. On high resolution imagery, it showed up on the Martian sands like a cloverleaf, proving it had survived the landing and hadn't crashed as feared. But what happened? Why didn't it radio home? The exact details are still unclear, but one likely scenario is based on how Beagle landed. Though the probe was protected by heat shields and slowed down by parachutes, its actual landing was achieved while encased in airbags to cushion the impact. NASA's experience with similar airbag landings show that spacecraft bounce much more than expected on Mars. It's possible that Beagle landed harder than planned and either bounced back into its parachute or continued to bounce as its airbags deflated, so it became tangled. When it opened, the images show that it could only deploy two of its four solar panels, and the airbag deflated on top of it, so it couldn't charge. In other words, when it came time to wake up, Beagle 2 got trapped in the bedding.

The United States has launched 29 missions to Mars, six of which were failures. But that’s still a pretty good track record. For comparison, the USSR launched 20 missions to Mars before its demise, and 17 of them either partially or completely failed.

# Expériences insolites de l'histoire de l'exploration spatiale

- [These Are 7 of The Strangest Experiments Humans Have Ever Done in Space](https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-space-experiments-conducted-by-humans) - Science Alert

- Galiléo : la Terre est-elle habitée ?
- TARDIS : des tardigrades dans l'espace
- Chang-E : des vers à soie sur la Lune

- Cet astronaute éjecté dans l'espace n'est pas un imposteur. C'est un satellite !
- 
- Une combinaison spatiale transformée en satellite : A spacesuit floats, untethered, away from the International Space Station ISS), the vast black void of space yawning before it. You may be relieved to learn that no humans were harmed in the making of this experiment - there's no one in the Russian Orlan spacesuit, nicknamed Ivan Ivanovitch or Mr Smith - it's stuffed with a bunch of old clothes and a radio transmitter. The idea was that old spacesuits could be used as satellites. SuitSat-1 - officially designated AMSAT-OSCAR 54 - was deployed on 3 February 2006, but the experiment was only partially successful; reports vary, with NASA claiming the transmitter had died shortly after release and Russia reporting a final transmission a whole fortnight later. The last confirmed signal was received on 18 February. SuitSat-1 went on to spend several months in silent orbit, before entering Earth's atmosphere and burning up on 7 September 2006.
- L'expérience de Galilée sur la Lune : In the late 16th century, Galileo Galilei dropped two spheres of unequal mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy. When both arrived on the ground at the same time, he'd countered classically established views, by showing mass had no bearing on gravitational acceleration. All objects, no matter the mass, should fall at the same rate - even if it's a feather and a hammer. On Earth, this is tricky to demonstrate due to air resistance. But nearly 400 years later, a human standing on the Moon repeated the experiment. On 2 August 1971, Commander David Scott of Apollo 15 took a geological hammer in one hand, and a falcon feather in the other. He raised them to a height of about 1.6 metres off the ground, and dropped them. Because the astronaut was essentially in a vacuum, without air resistance the two objects fell in sync. "Within the accuracy of the simultaneous release, the objects were observed to undergo the same acceleration and strike the lunar surface simultaneously," wrote NASA astronaut Joe Allen, "which was a result predicted by well-established theory, but a result nonetheless reassuring considering both the number of viewers that witnessed the experiment and the fact that the homeward journey was based critically on the validity of the particular theory being tested." The hammer and feather are both still up there.
- Des tortues autour de la Lune : Back in the 1960s, before humans had been to the Moon, it wasn't clear exactly how - if at all - getting up close and personal with the Moon would affect us physically. So, in 1968, the Soviet space program sent two Russian tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) up for a trip round Earth's companion. Actually, it wasn't just tortoises. Included in the flight were wine flies, mealworms, seeds, plants, algae and bacteria. There was also a dummy fitted with radiation sensors, since none of the living organisms aboard were remotely analogous to humans. Tortoises, according to a 1969 report, seem to have been chosen because they're relatively easy to strap down. The two unnamed reptilian cosmonauts were placed onboard the Zond-5 spacecraft on 2 September 1968, at which point they were no longer fed. They were launched into space on 15 September 1968, returning back to Earth (in the Indian ocean) on 21 September. They finally returned to Moscow on 7 October. Their journey included seven days of spaceflight, several days in tropical climates (including bobbing about in the ocean while they waited for retrieval) and transportation back to Russia. Ultimately, they spent 39 days without food. It would try anyone. Control tortoises that remained on Earth were also deprived of food for the same time period. A comparison of the two sets of tortoises revealed that any changes in the space-faring reptiles were mostly the result of starvation, with a small contribution from spaceflight-related atrophy. We'd like to say that no one ever sent tortoises to space again, but sadly, two more tortoise missions took place. Zond 7 in 1969 carried tortoises. In 1975, the Soyuz 20 spacecraft ferried a tortoise around for 90 days. And two tortoises flew on the Salyut-5 space station in 1976.
- Des araignées en impesanteur : In 2011, scientists set about answering the burning question: Can spiders adapt to space travel? They sent two golden silk orb-weaver spiders (Trichonephila clavipes), Esmeralda and Gladys, for a 45-day sojourn aboard the ISS. They were kept in a nice habitat (can you imagine spiders loose on a space station), with light conditions to simulate a night-day cycle, temperature and humidity control, and a healthy diet of juicy fruit flies. Both spiders adapted beautifully, continuing to spin their webs and hunt their food. Orb weavers eat their webs at the end of each day to regain protein, and spin them again in the morning; this, too, the spiders continued to do right on schedule, which was interesting, since different orb weaver species on the ISS just spun their webs at any old time of day. But not everything was totally normal. In microgravity, the spiders spun their webs differently - flatter and rounder, compared to the more three-dimensional, asymmetrical structures the orb-weavers spin on Earth. The two spiders returned to Earth at the end of their stay in space. Esmeralda perished on the return journey, having lived a normal spider lifespan. Gladys returned home hale, but turned out to be a boy. He was renamed Gladstone.

- Voici l'endroit le plus isolé de toute la planète.
- Le point NEMO, comme on l'appelle, est situé au plein coeur de l'océan Pacifique.
- Les terres émergées les plus proches de cette zone se trouvent à plus de 2 600 km de distance !
- Autour du point NEMO, il n'y a pas d'habitation, pas de traffic maritime ou aérien et très peu de poissons. 
- Par contre, on y trouve une très forte concentration... De vaisseaux spatiaux !
- Le point NEMO est en effet un cimetière d'épaves spatiales. 
- C'est ici que les agences spatiales du monde entier envoient leurs débris spatiaux de grande taille et les satellites en fin de vie qui sont encore contrôlables.
- L'idée, c'est de faire en sorte que ces débris de l'espace évitent le destin de ce bout de fusée qui s'est écrasé près de la ville de GeorgeTown au Texas en 97.
- Le point NEMO abrite aujourd'hui plus de 260 engins en tous genres, qui reposent au fond de l'océan. 
- Le plus célèbre de ces trésors est sans doute l'épave de la station spatiale MIR, qui s'y est crashée en 2001 à la fin de sa mission.
- Et le point NEMO sera aussi la dernière demeure de l'ISS, la station spatiale internationale, qui devrait être désorbitée vers 2028.

- Ce stylo a évité aux premiers humains sur la Lune... De mourir sur place.
- Le 20 Juillet 1969, après quelques cabrioles sur la surface lunaire, Neil Armstrong et Buzz Aldrin se préparent à rentrer dans le module lunaire qui va les ramener à la maison.
- Mais alors que les deux astronautes se glissent dans l'écoutille du vaisseau, la combinaison d'Aldrin heurte un interrupteur sur l'un des panneaux de contrôle, et le brise.
- L'incident aurait pu se produire sur n'importe lequel des dizaines d'interrupteurs que comptait le panneau. 
- Mais il a fallu que ça tombe sur LE SEUL qui activait la mise à feu du module lunaire ! Sans cette pièce, impossible de redécoller.
- Ah la boulette...
- Heureusement, Aldrin a sur lui un stylo qui, PAR CHANCE, a le bon diamètre pour être inséré dans le poussoir pour activer le circuit.
- Le module lunaire a donc pu décoller donc sans encombre, et les astronautes ont pu rentrer chez eux, ainsi que dans l'Histoire.
- Quant au stylo, il est aujourd'hui exposé au Museum of Flight de Seattle.

## Les diamants de Neptune

- Il pleut des diamants sur Neptune !
- Au début des années 80, le physicien Marvin Ross a émis l'hypothèse que les conditions de pressions et de températures à l'intérieur de l'atmosphère de Neptune sont si extrêmes que les atomes de carbone qu'elle contient doivent être comprimés au point d'en faire des diamants.
- Mais il a fallu atteindre 2017 avant qu'on ait enfin la confirmation expérimentale de cette idée.
- Pour cela, des chercheurs de l'université de Stanford ont reproduit les conditions atmosphériques de Neptune en tirant sur des bouts de polystyrène avec des lasers surpuissants.
- Non, c'est pas une blague, et oui, ça marche très bien, parce qu'ils ont réussi à former des diamants en à peine quelques nanosecondes !
- On pense aujourd'hui que ces diamants se forment en continu dans les profondeurs de l'atmosphère de Neptune, et qu'ils peuvent grossir jusqu'à atteindre 200 kg avant de tomber sur le noyau de la planète. 
- Ce phénomène hallucinant fait de l'atmosphère de Neptune l'un des panoramas les plus exotiques du système solaire.

- Ce poème... Est vivant !
- I have been striving to write a short verse about language and genetics, whereupon I use a “chemical alphabet” to translate this poem into a sequence of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium (in this case, a microbe called Deinococcus radiodurans—an extremophile, capable of surviving, without mutation, in even the most hostile milieus, including the vacuum of outer space).
- When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell, my poem is going to constitute a set of instructions, all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable, benign protein in response—a protein that, according to my original, chemical alphabet, is itself yet another text. I am, in effect, engineering a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem—one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes….
- Yesterday, I received confirmation from the laboratory at the University of Calgary that my poetic cipher, gene X-P13, has in fact caused E. coli to fluoresce red in our test-runs—meaning that, when implanted in the genome of this bacterium, my poem (which begins “any style of life/ is prim…”) does in fact cause the bacterium to write, in response, its own poem (which begins “the faery is rosy/ of glow…”). I have finally demonstrated the viability of the gene (which has taken me about a year to design).
- un projet colossal qu’a entrepris l’audacieux et ingénieux poète Christian Bök, il y a presque quinze ans et qui se poursuit…. The Xenotext a comme défi non seulement de simplement insérer un poème codé (Orphée/ADN) dans une bactérie, mais que celui-ci induise la synthèse d’un autre poème (Eurydice/ARN) composé tous deux par Christian Bök, qui a dû apprendre en accéléré des notions de microbiologie, génétique, biochimie, informatique.  Après avoir réussi avec le E.Coli, d’éviter que sa poésie soit génétiquement modifiée ou tronquée par l’organisme,  il travaille maintenant avec nul autre que Deinococcus radiodurans;  surnommée parfois Hulk ou Conan, cette impressionnante polyextrêmophile bactérie ayant une résistance phénoménale face à la radiation, l’ionisation, l’oxydation, le froid ou la chaleur intense, etc. survivrait même à une catastrophe apocalyptique  assurant ainsi la pérennité de son Xenotext.
- His on-going project is named The Xenotext experiment: he proposed to encipher a short verse into a sequence of DNA that would be subsequently engineered into the genome of the bacterium D. radiodurans.
D. radiodurans is a well-known super-resistant microorganism, likely to be capable of surviving a planetary collapse for far longer than we could imagine.
- nterestingly, Bök’s concept moves beyond a simple solution for the long-term storage of poetic compositions that might survive human extinction: his genetically modified bacterial strain is also expected to produce literature itself.

The secret behind this natural creative behaviour is the elegant enciphering code developed by the experimental poet, together with a team of molecular biologists.
In essence, every alphabetical letter is assigned to a specific codon, which is then re-encrypted into a different letter. This unique correspondence between the original letter and the resulting letter is organized in order to transduce the introduced short verse into a newly formed meaningful one
- To note: a codon (or triplet) consists of three nucleotides. During mRNA (messenger RNA) translation into a protein, every codon is assigned to a specific amino acid. A sequence of amino acids constitutes the primary structure of a protein
- Firstly, the success of the project relies on the biochemical quality of the engineered protein. It must undergo proper folding, being stable enough to avoid immediate degradation by the host. However, at the same time its cellular activity should be negligible, in order to have a good chance of being silently passed through generations and become a stable cellular feature.
- If everything works well, the original sonnet Orpheus, that starts with Any style of life/is prim, will give rise to a second sonnet Eurydice, that starts with The faery is rosy/of glow (Fig. 1B).
Therefore, the legendary musician Orpheus will be finally able to resurrect his wife Eurydice from the damnation of Hades, making eternal their unity.
- Ce n'est pas la première fois que du texte est encodé dand de l'ADN de bactérie
- Le vœu de Christian Bök va plus loin : en plus d'insérer un texte original, celui-ci « est aussi écrit de manière à ce que l'organisme où il est implanté puisse en faire une protéine, qui serait elle-même un autre poème complètement différent ». Un nouveau code se crée alors à l'intérieur de la bactérie, transformant le texte pour donner naissance à un nouveau qui ait du sens. L'organisme ne cessant de se multiplier, cela permettrait également de multiplier l'œuvre de manière exponentielle.
- How and who would later decode those messages—first written in American Standard English and then translated into a DNA sequence, in Bök’s project—is a question we should certainly raise.
-  the final section of Bök’s project proposal (or more aptly, manifesto). “I believe,” he writes, “that such a poem, stored inside the genome of a bacterium, might conceivably outlast terrestrial civilization itself, persisting like a secret message in a bottle flung at random into a giant ocean." At the same time, he observes, "I hope that my poem might urge readers to reconsider the aesthetic potential of science, causing them to recognize that, buried within the building blocks of life, there really does exist an innate beauty, if not a hidden poetry—a literal message that we might read, if only we deign to look for it.”
-  Le jour précédant cette découverte, le 3 avril 2011, Bök avait déclaré « avoir reçu la confirmation du laboratoire de l'Université de Calgary que [son] code poétique, le gène X-P13, avait bel et bien causé un changement de couleur à la bactérie E. coli au rouge phosphorescent. Cela signifie qu'une fois implanté dans le génome de cette bactérie [son] poème (qui commence par ‘‘toute forme de vie / est première...’’) amène en effet la bactérie à écrire son propre poème (qui commence par ‘‘la fée est rose / de brillance...’’)9’10.»
- Le projet s'est déroulé sur plus d'une décennie, coûtant plus de 110 000 $. 
- Bök intends his poems to outlast human civilization, and indeed the planet itself. And his authorial palette is not typical either: rather than inscribing his poems on paper, he’s attempting to put them in a bacterium.
- As a proof of concept, Wong and his colleagues inserted a tiny message—the lyrics of the song “It’s a small world after all”— encoded in DNA into the genome of this bacterium and allowed it to multiply for 100 generations. The embedded song survived without mutations, according to work published in 2003 (2). Although 100 generations isn’t many for showing genetic stability, Wong had offered up proof-of-principle that Deinococcus messages could persist unaltered.
-  The Xenotext (4). When completed, it will be a book of poetry crafted not of paper and glue but of DNA and protein, bound within an extremophile. The organism’s genome would encipher a 14-line poem by Bök, named “Orpheus.” The bug’s replication machinery would read the DNA and assemble a protein. The sequence of amino acids would encipher another 14-line poem, called “Eurydice.” Hence, the bug would be both a storage vessel and a poem-generator. The protein would also make the bug fluoresce red via an mCherry red fluorophore tag.
-  “Orpheus” begins with these lines:"Any style of life""is prim"

To which the organism responds by building a protein that encodes “Eurydice”:"The faery is rosy""of glow"
- It took Bök 4 years to write the poems, which are basic cryptograms. He had to write two poems simultaneously: the DNA spells out one poem and the amino acid the other. The two poems are ciphers of each other.

Bök taught himself programming to build software that generated simple substitution ciphers, where each letter of the alphabet is paired with another letter. In his poems, “a,” for example, maps to “t,” “n” to “h,” and so on.

Of 7 trillion cipher possibilities, Bök found one cipher that produced a lexicon that had enough useful words (about 120) that could be assembled into two poems that are also sensible and syntactical.

He next translated the poems into the language of living things. Each letter of the cipher maps to a DNA codon, the triplet of DNA molecules that encode an amino acid. The bug would read the codon and build an amino acid, which in turn would map to the original’s letter-matching pair in the cipher.
- on the final day of his grant, Bök received word from the Wyoming scientists: the bug had successfully incorporated “Orpheus” in its genome. It was also generating “Eurydice” in response. Still, their excitement was tempered; they only saw fragments of the protein poem during electrophoresis.
- Bök has three benchmarks of success for The Xenotext: the gene has to be properly introduced into Deinococcus; it has to generate a protein that fluoresces red, matching the opening lines of “Eurydice”; and the protein has to be stable enough to be detected.

The last criterion has not been met. 
- The Xenotext, he emphasizes, is not an expression of hubris. It is an aesthetic exercise meant to get people thinking about human extinction and to prompt poets to use living beings as a mode of artistic expression, he says. After all, even with Deinococcus’ stellar DNA repair machinery, the “Orpheus” gene will likely mutate, given enough time, because of chance alone.
- ök’sThe Xenotext: Book1, published in 2015, involved enciphering poetry into the genome of the bacteriumDeinococ-cus radiodurans. The organism’s cellular mechanisms“read”the encoded poem and produceda protein, the structure of which was then deciphered, resulting in another poem in response.
- Pak Chung Wong at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has recently demonstrated that even now scientists might store data by encoding sequences of textual information into sequences of genetic nucleotides, thereby creating "messages" made from DNA--messages that we can implant, like genes, inside bacterial organisms. Wong has enciphered, for example, the lyrics to "It's a Small World After All," storing this text as a plasmid of DNA inside Deinococcus radiodurans--a bacterium resistant to inhospitable environments. 
- I am hoping to encipher my text and then integrate it into the genome of the organism, doing so in such a way that, not only does the organism become an archive for storing my poem, but moreover the organism also becomes a machine for writing a poem. I am hoping to design a text that, when implanted, does not injure the organism, but that instead causes it to generate a protein--one that, according to my cipher, is itself another text. I foresee that, in the future, DNA might become yet another poetic medium. 
- The Xenotext is my nine-year long attempt to create an example of “living poetry.” I have been striving to write a short verse about language and genetics, whereupon I use a “chemical alphabet” to translate this poem into a sequence of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium (in this case, a microbe called Deinococcus radiodurans—an extremophile, capable of surviving, without mutation, in even the most hostile milieus, including the vacuum of outer space).
When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell, my poem is going to constitute a set of instructions, all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable, benign protein in response - a protein that, according to my original, chemical alphabet, is itself yet another text. I am, in effect, engineering a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem - one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes….
Yesterday, I received confirmation from the laboratory at the University of Calgary that my poetic cipher, gene X-P13, has in fact caused E. coli to fluoresce red in our test-runs, meaning that, when implanted in the genome of this bacterium, my poem (which begins “any style of life/ is prim…”) does in fact cause the bacterium to write, in response, its own poem (which begins “the faery is rosy/ of glow…”). I have finally demonstrated the viability of the gene (which has taken me about a year to design)

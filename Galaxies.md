- ***Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey***
- telescopes have helped us capture light from galaxies that formed as far back as 400 million years after the big bang – incredibly early in the context of the universe’s 13.8-billion-year history
- the James Webb Space Telescope, is poised to add new riches to our wealth of knowledge not only by capturing images from galaxies that existed as early as the first few hundred million years after the big bang, but also by giving us detailed data known as spectra. With Webb’s observations, researchers will be able to tell us about the makeup and composition of individual galaxies in the early universe for the first time.
- The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey, co-led by Steven L. Finkelstein, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, will target the same two regions that make up the Hubble Ultra Deep Field – locations in the constellation Fornax where Hubble spent more than 11 days taking deep exposures.
- For the imaging with NIRCam, they’ll observe for over 125 hours. 
- What do they seek? Some of the earliest galaxies that formed. “We have really good indications from Hubble that there are galaxies in place at a time 400 million years after the big bang,” Finkelstein said. “The ones we see with Hubble are pretty big and very bright. It’s highly likely there are smaller, fainter galaxies that formed even earlier that are waiting to be found.”
- This program will use only about one-third of the time Hubble has spent to date on similar investigations. Why? In part, this is because Webb’s instruments were designed to capture infrared light. As light travels through space toward us, it stretches into longer, redder wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe.
- These researchers will also focus on identifying the metal content in each galaxy, especially in smaller and dimmer galaxies that haven’t yet been thoroughly examined – specifically with the spectra Webb’s NIRISS instrument delivers. “One of the fundamental ways that we trace evolution across cosmic time is by the amount of metals that are in a galaxy,”
- “Its data will help us learn precisely what happens as a galaxy forms, including which metals they contain, how quickly they grow, and if they already have black holes

- ***James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)***
- JADES will use guaranteed time in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) cycle 1 to produce infrared imaging and spectroscopy of unprecedented depth in the two premier extragalactic deep fields, GOODS-South (CDF-S) and GOODS-North (HDF)
- JADES expects to collect data on about 100,000 galaxies, adding to the extensive legacy of these well-studied fields.
- JADES is a collaboration of the JWST Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument teams and will comprise about 800 hours of observing time

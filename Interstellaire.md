# Quelle science réaliser avec une sonde interstellaire 

- An Interstellar Probe escaping beyond the solar-system boundaries with new observational techniques would be a bold move in space exploration, enabling detailed, new understanding of the global heliosphere in the context of other astrospheres, further discoveries of unexplored Kuiper Belt Objects, and the first observations of our circumsolar dust disk. These would offer insight into the evolution of the solar system and our understanding of exoplanetary systems. 
- Interstellar Boundary Explorer (en français « Explorateur de la frontière interstellaire »), plus connu sous son acronyme IBEX, est un petit satellite scientifique de la NASA chargé de cartographier l'héliopause c'est-à-dire la frontière séparant l'héliosphère (région de l'espace sous l'influence du Soleil) du milieu interstellaire.
- Le satellite lancé le 19 octobre 2008 par un lanceur aéroporté Pegasus XL circule sur une orbite haute autour de la Terre. La durée nominale de la mission est de deux ans mais IBEX est toujours opérationnel en 2019. 
- La mission d'IBEX est de cartographier la frontière délimitant le Système solaire, où se rencontrent le vent solaire et les rayons galactiques du milieu interstellaire. Ainsi, les mesures d'IBEX vont compléter les données envoyées par les sondes spatiales Voyager 1 et Voyager 2, qui ont traversé cette frontière respectivement en 2004 et 2007. Cette frontière, l'héliosphère, est importante car, si les rayons galactiques n'étaient pas arrêtés dans cette zone, ils rendraient les vols spatiaux habités bien plus dangereux pour l'Homme. 
- - Nominally an “Interstellar Probe” is a mission through the outer heliosphere and to the nearby “Very Local” interstellar medium or VLISM (0.01 parsecs = ∼2000 AU = ∼10 light days). As with the study of other systems in space, exploration is something that occurs stepwise, as both technology, and more importantly, the science answers and questions evolve with new information. While Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, all on solar-system escape trajectories have and continue to contribute to our knowledge of the outer heliosphere and, especially for Voyager 1, the regions beyond, none of these missions was designed with the science of the interstellar medium per se as a primary science driver.
- The science objectives can be organized into four topics or targets [45]:

Target 1: Interstellar Medium and Heliosphere.

Target 2: Circum-Solar Dust Disk.

Target 3: Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).

Target 4: Large Trans-Neptunian Planets.
- We know from our own system that the Sun's magnetic field blows a “bubble” in the local interstellar medium, which we refer to as the heliosphere. The size and shape have been, and continue to be, a matter of some debate [46] and run the gamut between a semi-spherical bubble confined by the local interstellar magnetic field [47] and a “wind-sock” with asymmetry driven by the local interstellar wind [3] as the two limiting cases [48]. Although the latter had been preferred, new measurements both in energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from Cassini [49] and the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) [50] and in charged energetic particles from the Voyagers [51] have lent new evidence for a “tail-less” heliosphere [52].
- Given the ubiquitous nature of stellar magnetic fields, the association of “astrospheres” with stars other than our Sun is accepted as a foregone conclusion. At the same time, ongoing data from the Voyagers and IBEX are revealing that our own surroundings are more complex than we had thought [53].
- The nature of the IBEX “ribbon” [54] and of anomalous cosmic rays [55] continue to be debated as well.
- The relevant questions that have emerged in various forms in studies and reports ([56] and references therein) and have driven mission concept designs have remained unchanged:

1.

    What is the nature of the nearby interstellar medium?
2.

    How do the Sun and galaxy affect the dynamics of the heliosphere?
3.

    What is the structure of the heliosphere?
4.

    How did matter in the solar system and interstellar medium originate and evolve?
    
While the distribution of the asteroids and KBOs is relatively well known, the dust production and evolution in the Kuiper Belt remains unclear. 

 the large-scale dust distribution beyond the zodiacal cloud is largely unknown because the observational vantage points in infrared are all within this cloud. 
 
 From a vantage point outside the solar system Interstellar Probe provides a unique platform to observe the entire extent of the zodiacal cloud and to resolve, if there, a second Kuiper belt dust cloud isolated by the outer planets, as predicted by Stark and Kuchner
 
 At 40–50 AU, conveniently lining up with the nose direction of the heliosphere and the mysterious so-called “Ribbon” of energetic neutral atoms [54] lies the dwarf planet Quaoar [59,60], which may be in the last stages of losing a methane atmosphere [61]. Lying between volatile-dominated and volatile-poor objects, Quaoar offers a unique object for exploration. Surprisingly, crystalline ice has been detected on the surface implying cryo-volcanism active in the past or even still active [62]. Quaoar therefore represents one of the possible targets that could unveil yet another unexpectedly exotic world of a KBO with critical implications for planetary formation. Quaoar also harbors its own moonlet (Weywot). Investigating this pair would provide further data on the birth and evolution of KBOs.
 
 Distant orbits of objects in the scattered-disk populations of the Kuiper Belt exhibit apparent clustering in the arguments of their perihelia. Batygin and Brown [63] have shown that this distribution could be explained by a distant planet of up to ten times the mass of Earth in an orbit with eccentricity of 0.6 and a semi-major axis of 700 AU, corresponding to a periapsis of 280 AU and apoapsis of 1120 AU. In addition, the newly discovered 2015 BP519 may be the first member of a high-inclination population purely induced by a large trans-Neptunian planet [64]. Other hypotheses exist, which may explain the KBO clustering [65]. However, if observationally confirmed, a large trans-Neptunian planet would be an extremely intriguing flyby target for an Interstellar Probe.
 
 

# Historique

- The “Interstellar Probe” to the nearby interstellar medium has been discussed in depth for about 60 years (the origins of the concept from 1958 through the end of NASA's Project Prometheus in 2005
- the early discussions focused on schemes of relativistic space flight [[10], [11], [12]] as a requirement for “exploratory”, and, hence, “fast” trips. The problem of driving any mechanical assembly to such high speeds led to an immediate focus on “photon propulsion” based upon tapping into the energy theoretically accessible via matter – anti-matter annihilation [13,14]. Other schemes were also proposed such as the “fusion ramjet” [15], even though then, as now, establishment of controlled fusion power was itself elusive, without the additional complexity of adopting it for space travel
- Alternative speculations, with an equally long history and also tracing back to Goddard's [8] and Tsander's [9] papers, looked to “slow” “world ships,” which would make the very distant trip to other stars in centuries or millennia.
- With the maturing space age, and especially the launches of Pioneers 10 and 11 to the outer solar system and beyond, the science case for in situ exploration of the nearby interstellar medium and the boundary of the heliosphere (“… the region of interplanetary space where the solar wind is flowing supersonically.” [26]) became more focused on the nearby interstellar medium [27]. Such “precursor” (to true interstellar travel) missions became the scientific spacecraft focus [[5], [6], [7],28]. While such mission concepts are typically referred to as an “Interstellar Probe", but with varying distances from the Sun, e.g. Refs. [2,29], they all (typically) refer to the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) out to 0.01 parsecs or ∼2000 AU
- The New Horizons spacecraft was launched to the Pluto system in January 2006
- In the 1970s (1978) members of The British Interplanetary 
Society  (BIS)  designed  an  interstellar  flyby  spacecraft 
called  Daedalus 


# Technologies de propulsion

There are no currently available low-thrust technologies that can apply to Interstellar Probe, which have been demonstrated. Solar electric propulsion (SEP), although demonstrated on the Deep Space-1 [76] and Dawn [77] missions can provide no long-term acceleration beyond the asteroid belt due to the increasing distance from the Sun.

## La manoeuvre d'Oberth

To consider option 3, the Oberth maneuver, we first need to take up the subject of thermal shields – the thermal protection system (TPS) – and the reality of taking a spacecraft very, very close to the Sun.

Oberth pointed out in 1929 that the most rapid escape from the solar system could be effected by a powered spacecraft maneuver deep in the Sun's gravity well by a spacecraft that falls toward the Sun from a large distance 

To maximize the effect of the burn, it must be applied as close to perihelion as possible and at high thrust over a short (preferably minutes) period of time to minimize gravitational losses.

After many years of research and development, materials and concepts were developed [83] to enable the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to approach a perihelion distance (from the center of the Sun) of 9.86 Rs. Given the specific impulse (Isp) [84] of solid rocket fuel, a simple, solid kick stage might provide ∼3 km/s for
. At the eventual perihelion of PSP, this would provide , about twice the current escape speed of Voyager 1, the fastest object ever to leave the solar system.

The question is whether such a maneuver can be better exploited. Rough estimates suggest that for such a maneuver to be efficacious, the spacecraft perihelion must at least be as small as 5 Rs

At solar distances closer than about 6 Rs the external shield surface temperatures exceed 2000 °C and by 3 Rs they are around 3000 °C. There are more than 300 materials with melting temperatures above 2000 °C, but only 15 above 3000 °C 

## Où aller 

- Dans les 15 années lumière à la ronde (la portée maximum du projet Icarus), on recense environ 56 étoiles situées dans 38 systèmes stellaires différents.
> Une étoile de type spectral A (Sirius), une de type F (Procyon), 2 de type G (α Centauri A et τ Ceti), 5 étoiles de type K, 41 étoiles de types M (naines rouges), 3 naines blanches et 3 naines brunes potentielles
- L'étoile la plus proche se trouve à 272 000 unités astronomiques (4,3 années lumière)

## Problème de la propulsion chimique

A quick review of the various concepts will immediatelyshow that many of those schemes are ruled out. This includes chemical, electric and nuclearﬁssion [4]. This is largely due to either a lack of speciﬁc impulse or a lack of thrust to givehigh exhaust velocity. A high exhaust velocity would be necessary to reach the speeds that arerequired to travel to another star within the time span of a human lifetime

## le projet Orion

The idea of using nuclear pulse propulsion was ﬁrst proposed by Stanislaw Ulam in 1947 andsubsequently resulted in an engineering study led by Ted Taylor[10]. This was to employ nuclearpulse technology to propel a vehicle by capturing the blast products of a nuclear explosion onthe rear of a giant pusher plate, transferring momentum to the spacecraft and its occupants,cushioned from the blast by several shock absorbers. This eventually led to the Project Orionengineering study with around $11 million being spent over a period of 7 years. The design wasfor a mission which would take only
approx
140 years to reach Alpha Centauri with 1 ‘unit of propellant’ being exploded every 3 seconds to push the spacecraft at 1g acceleration to
≈
3% of light speed [11]. However, with the arrival of various test ban treaties external nuclear pulse wasshelved to the archives. Despite this, Project Orion remains the ﬁrst comprehensive interstellarspacecraft design which was credible.

## Le projet Daedalus

- Dans les années 70, un groupe de réflexion bénévole constitué de membres de la British Interplanetary Society s'est réunis pour discuter de la faisabilité théorique d'une mission interstellaire.
- Le résultat de leurs réflexions a été publié dans un rapport intitulé "Project Daedalus" en 1978. Ce rapport constitue l'une des études les plus exhaustives à ce jour sur ce thème  
- Dans le scénario développé par les membres de la BIS, une sonde interstellaire est envoyée vers l'étoile de Barnard
> * La sonde est propulsée par fusion nucléaire, alimentée par une mixture de deutérium et d'hélium 3.
- Pour récolter son carburant, les auteurs du rapport ont imaginé que la sonde irait collecter du deutérium et de l'hélium 3 dans l'atmosphère des planètes géantes du système solaire
> * En pratique cela pose problème, parce que ces planètes constituent des puits gravitationnels très profonds du fait de leur masse, ce qui fait qu'il est extrêmement difficile de s'extraire de leur attraction.
> * La vitesse de libération d'Uranus est de 21,3 km/s, celle de Neptune 23,5 km/s, celle de Saturne 35,5 km/s et celle de Jupiter 59,5 km/s. En comparaison, celle de la Terre n'est que de 11,2 km/s. 
 
During the 1970s members of the British Interplanetary Society embarked on a landmark the-oretical engineering design study to send a probe to Barnard’s star. Project Daedalus was atwo-stage vehicle employing electron beam driven inertial conﬁnement fusion engines to reachits target destination.

Then inJanuary 1973 members of the BIS ﬁrst met to discuss the challenges of interstellar propulsionand the idea of Project Daedalus was born. Led by Alan Bond, Tony Martin and Bob Parkinson,members came together to create what has become one of the most comprehensive interstellarengineering studies ever undertaken. Project Daedalus had three stated guidelines:1. The spacecraft must use current or near future technology.2. The spacecraft must reach its destination within a human lifetime.3. The spacecraft must be designed to allow for a variety of target stars.The members of the Daedalus study group were all volunteers but with a solid knowledgeof engineering and science. The ﬁnal design was published in 1978 [13]and was a two-stagespacecraft nearly 200m in length powered by electron driven D/He
3
fusion reactions, eventuallyaccelerating up to 12% of light speed to arrive at its target destination Barnards star 5.9 lightyears away in under 50 years. 

The second stage carried a 450 tonnescientiﬁc payload with 18 probes to be used to study the target solar system planets.


## Le projet Icarus

This is an attempt to redesign the Daedalus vehicle with similar termsof reference. The aim of this study is to evolve an improved engineering design and move uscloser to achieving interstellar exploration. 

Project Icarus: son of Daedalus - ﬂying closer to another star. This is the vision of this theoret-ical design study to re-examine the engineering solution and fundamental assumptions behindProject Daedalus. Like Daedalus, the intention is for Icarus to use fusion based engines and toquote Alan Bond from the recent BIS symposium “now we are addressing the universe on itsown terms”. This was in reference to the utility of using fusion power to visit the stars - whichare themselves fusion powered

Project Icarus is a Tau Zero Foundation initiative in collaboration with The British Inter-planetary Society and so represents a true collaboration of international volunteers all sharingin the vision of a human presence in space in the coming centuries.

The purpose of Project Icarus is as follows:1. To design a credible interstellar probe that is a concept design for a potential mission inthe coming centuries.2. To allow a direct technology comparison with Daedalus and provide an assessment of thematurity of fusion based space propulsion for future precursor missions.3. To generate greater interest in the real term prospects for interstellar precursor missionsthat are based on credible science.4. To motivate a new generation of scientists to be interested in designing space missionsthat go beyond our solar system.

One of the biggest assumptions of Project Daedalus was the use of a ﬂyby probe. ProjectIcarus will re-examine this assumption, and the terms of reference for the study stipulate thatdeceleration of the spacecraft at the target destination is a mission requirement. One optioncould be the use of mini-probes which are separated from the main bus to be decelerated intothe target system whilst the main spacecraft carries on in its trajectory. Another option couldbe achieved by using a magnetic sail otherwise known as a MagSail. This uses a magnetic ﬁeldto deﬂect charged particles contained within the solar wind emitted from the destination star,which decelerates the spacecraft.



## Le projet Longshot

Another study in the 1980’s was Project Longshot[16] whichproposed using D/He

reactions driven by either laser or electron beams to accelerate a missionto Alpha Centauri within a century by reaching a speed of 5% of light and by having a speciﬁcimpulse of 10

## Propulsion Alcubierre

Although there are exotic concepts for interstellar travel such as warp drive and wormholes,these are currently considered to be purely speculative [6,7]. Concepts such as antimatter have been investigated but the technology is currently too immature to harness for a spacecraft

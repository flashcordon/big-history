# Quelle science réaliser avec une sonde interstellaire 

- An Interstellar Probe escaping beyond the solar-system boundaries with new observational techniques would be a bold move in space exploration, enabling detailed, new understanding of the global heliosphere in the context of other astrospheres, further discoveries of unexplored Kuiper Belt Objects, and the first observations of our circumsolar dust disk. These would offer insight into the evolution of the solar system and our understanding of exoplanetary systems. 
- Interstellar Boundary Explorer (en français « Explorateur de la frontière interstellaire »), plus connu sous son acronyme IBEX, est un petit satellite scientifique de la NASA chargé de cartographier l'héliopause c'est-à-dire la frontière séparant l'héliosphère (région de l'espace sous l'influence du Soleil) du milieu interstellaire.
- Le satellite lancé le 19 octobre 2008 par un lanceur aéroporté Pegasus XL circule sur une orbite haute autour de la Terre. La durée nominale de la mission est de deux ans mais IBEX est toujours opérationnel en 2019. 
- La mission d'IBEX est de cartographier la frontière délimitant le Système solaire, où se rencontrent le vent solaire et les rayons galactiques du milieu interstellaire. Ainsi, les mesures d'IBEX vont compléter les données envoyées par les sondes spatiales Voyager 1 et Voyager 2, qui ont traversé cette frontière respectivement en 2004 et 2007. Cette frontière, l'héliosphère, est importante car, si les rayons galactiques n'étaient pas arrêtés dans cette zone, ils rendraient les vols spatiaux habités bien plus dangereux pour l'Homme. 
- - Nominally an “Interstellar Probe” is a mission through the outer heliosphere and to the nearby “Very Local” interstellar medium or VLISM (0.01 parsecs = ∼2000 AU = ∼10 light days). As with the study of other systems in space, exploration is something that occurs stepwise, as both technology, and more importantly, the science answers and questions evolve with new information. While Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, all on solar-system escape trajectories have and continue to contribute to our knowledge of the outer heliosphere and, especially for Voyager 1, the regions beyond, none of these missions was designed with the science of the interstellar medium per se as a primary science driver.
- The science objectives can be organized into four topics or targets [45]:

Target 1: Interstellar Medium and Heliosphere.

Target 2: Circum-Solar Dust Disk.

Target 3: Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).

Target 4: Large Trans-Neptunian Planets.
- We know from our own system that the Sun's magnetic field blows a “bubble” in the local interstellar medium, which we refer to as the heliosphere. The size and shape have been, and continue to be, a matter of some debate [46] and run the gamut between a semi-spherical bubble confined by the local interstellar magnetic field [47] and a “wind-sock” with asymmetry driven by the local interstellar wind [3] as the two limiting cases [48]. Although the latter had been preferred, new measurements both in energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from Cassini [49] and the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) [50] and in charged energetic particles from the Voyagers [51] have lent new evidence for a “tail-less” heliosphere [52].
- Given the ubiquitous nature of stellar magnetic fields, the association of “astrospheres” with stars other than our Sun is accepted as a foregone conclusion. At the same time, ongoing data from the Voyagers and IBEX are revealing that our own surroundings are more complex than we had thought [53].
- The nature of the IBEX “ribbon” [54] and of anomalous cosmic rays [55] continue to be debated as well.
- The relevant questions that have emerged in various forms in studies and reports ([56] and references therein) and have driven mission concept designs have remained unchanged:

1.

    What is the nature of the nearby interstellar medium?
2.

    How do the Sun and galaxy affect the dynamics of the heliosphere?
3.

    What is the structure of the heliosphere?
4.

    How did matter in the solar system and interstellar medium originate and evolve?

# Historique

- The “Interstellar Probe” to the nearby interstellar medium has been discussed in depth for about 60 years (the origins of the concept from 1958 through the end of NASA's Project Prometheus in 2005
- the early discussions focused on schemes of relativistic space flight [[10], [11], [12]] as a requirement for “exploratory”, and, hence, “fast” trips. The problem of driving any mechanical assembly to such high speeds led to an immediate focus on “photon propulsion” based upon tapping into the energy theoretically accessible via matter – anti-matter annihilation [13,14]. Other schemes were also proposed such as the “fusion ramjet” [15], even though then, as now, establishment of controlled fusion power was itself elusive, without the additional complexity of adopting it for space travel
- Alternative speculations, with an equally long history and also tracing back to Goddard's [8] and Tsander's [9] papers, looked to “slow” “world ships,” which would make the very distant trip to other stars in centuries or millennia.
- With the maturing space age, and especially the launches of Pioneers 10 and 11 to the outer solar system and beyond, the science case for in situ exploration of the nearby interstellar medium and the boundary of the heliosphere (“… the region of interplanetary space where the solar wind is flowing supersonically.” [26]) became more focused on the nearby interstellar medium [27]. Such “precursor” (to true interstellar travel) missions became the scientific spacecraft focus [[5], [6], [7],28]. While such mission concepts are typically referred to as an “Interstellar Probe", but with varying distances from the Sun, e.g. Refs. [2,29], they all (typically) refer to the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) out to 0.01 parsecs or ∼2000 AU

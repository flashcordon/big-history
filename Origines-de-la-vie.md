- Depuis la découverte du cratère d'impact de Chixulub, associé à l'extinction massive des dinosaures non-aviens il y a 66 millions d'années, on connaît surtout les météorites pour leurs conséquences destructrices.
- On sait que pendant les premières centaines de millions d'années après la naissance de la Terre, notre planète a subi un intense bombardement de météorites.

- "meteorite impacts can generate both subaerial and submarine hydrothermal vents, abundant hydrothermal–sedimentary settings, and impact analogues for volcanic pumice rafts and splash pools. Impact events can also deliver and/or generate many of the necessary chemical ingredients for life and catalytic substrates such as clays as well. The role that impact cratering plays in fracturing planetary crusts and its effects on deep subsurface habitats for life are also discussed."
- We conclude with the recommendation that impact craters should be considered prime sites in the search for evidence of past life on Mars
- When taken together with theoretical and observational constraints on planet formation, numerical simulations, and studied samples from our closest neighbor, the Moon, a clearer picture emerges of the first few hundred million years of Earth's history. While the details are debated, it is now widely accepted that a cataclysmic impact event at ∼4.5 Ga between the proto-Earth and a Mars-sized object (“Theia”) led to the formation of the Moon (e.g., Canup, 2012; Ćuk and Stewart, 2012). For several million years after this event the surface temperature of Earth would have remained well above the known upper temperature limit for life, rendering it inhospitable. Cratering rates over the subsequent few hundred million years are the topic of ongoing debate. Based originally on the determination of a large concentration of ∼3.9 Ga ages in Apollo samples (e.g., Papanastassiou and Wasserburg, 1971; Tera et al., 1974), the concept of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) was proposed (see Chapman et al., 2007; Norman, 2009, and references therein). The scarcity of pre-3.9 Ga ages in Apollo samples as well as similar impact age distributions in some meteorites has led some to believe that the LHB was the result of a lunar terminal cataclysm (e.g., Cohen et al., 2000; Stöffler and Ryder, 2001; Kring and Cohen, 2002). Others have argued that this concentration of impact ages at ∼3.9 Ga is an artifact that reflects sampling biases (e.g., Hartmann, 2003; Zellner, 2017) or age resetting (Boehnke and Harrison, 2016), which resulted in a monotonic decay rate since ∼4.5 Ga. Regardless of whether or not there was a spike in cratering rates at ∼3.9 Ga, there is general consensus that, for the first half billion years of Solar System history, Earth experienced a higher rate of meteorite impacts relative to modern impact flux (cf. Chambers [2004] with Zellner [2017]), which further suggests that this prolonged bombardment continued to ∼3.4 Ga.
- Intriguingly, the ∼3.7–3.8 Ga Isua greenstone belt of Greenland, which temporally coincides with the end of this period of higher impact flux, has long been proposed to contain the earliest evidence for life, as indicated by the presence of highly negative δ13C values within carbonaceous inclusions found in apatite grains (Mojzsis et al., 1996). This coincidence, in part, led to the hypothesis of the impact frustration of life, whereby the intensity of impact cratering would have either precluded the existence of life prior to ∼3.8 Ga (Maher and Stevenson, 1988; Sleep et al., 1989) or extinguished its presence (Chyba, 1993), perhaps multiple times.
- Perhaps unsurprisingly, there has been a general tendency in the past few decades to think of impacts as primarily destructive events that would have endangered, rather than enabled, life on Early Earth, as most recently discussed in the work of Sleep (2018). This view was strengthened by the discovery of the ∼200 km diameter Chicxulub impact structure, Mexico, and its link to the mass extinction event that marks the end of the Cretaceous Period ∼66 million years ago (Schulte et al., 2010). However, if the carbon isotope ratios that were found preserved in metasedimentary rocks in Isua, Greenland (Ohtomo et al., 2014), and Labrador, Canada (Tashiro et al., 2017), are indeed evidence of life, then the origin of life would predate ∼3.8 to ∼3.9 Ga such that there would be sufficient evolution and accumulation of primitive organisms to leave an isotopically light carbon signature in the rock record. This is also supported by the recent discovery of putative fossilized microorganisms in rocks found in Quebec, Canada, hosted deposits interpreted as hydrothermal vent precipitates, and with a proposed age of >3.8 Ga and possibly as old at 4.2 Ga (Dodd et al., 2017). These findings beg the question: Why, or rather how, did life originate during such an inhospitable time in Earth's history—the Hadean—when impact rates were orders of magnitude higher than at the present day?
- we offer a solution that necessitates a paradigm shift in our view of the biological consequences of meteorite impact events on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe. We argue that impact events are not just isolated catastrophic geological events but a fundamental process in planetary evolution that plays an important role in the origin of life and in controlling planetary habitability.
- We review the beneficial effects for microbial life ranging from generating conditions conducive to the origin of life (e.g., clays that can act as catalytic substrates for organic reactions, serpentinization, atmospheric generation of hydrogen cyanide, and hot spring environments) to varied habitats for life that persist long after an impact event, including transient hydrothermal systems, endolithic habitats in impact glasses and impact shocked rocks, and impact crater lakes.
- On a planetary scale, numerical modelling has also shown that there is no plausible scenario in which the habitable zone could be fully sterilized during the period of intense cratering on early Earth (Abramov and Mojzsis, 2009; Grimm and Marchi, 2018). On the contrary, it is during the thermobaric phase that the first new habitats are created through fracturing, shock metamorphism, and melting
- At the end of thermobaric phases, the biosphere is significantly disrupted in the immediate area surrounding impact with local areas of sterilization. Subsequently, primary succession of the landscape will occur (Cockell and Lee, 2002). One of the significant outcomes of the thermobaric phase is the disruption of the local hydrosphere and/or cryosphere. Over the subsequent days to years, groundwater, if present, will flow into the newly formed hydraulic void represented by the crater structure. Coupled with precipitation and the melting of surface and subsurface ice deposits, where applicable, the influx of water into the crater depression can lead to the generation of a crater lake, potentially within days or weeks (Figs. 2, 5). Crater lakes in and of themselves represent important habitats
- It has become increasingly clear from studies of craters on Earth over the past couple of decades that interaction of fluids from crater lakes and other sources with hot impact-generated and impact-altered rocks can generate transient hydrothermal systems (e.g., Newsom, 1980; Naumov, 2005; Kirsimäe and Osinski, 2012; Osinski et al., 2013) that can persist for tens of thousands of years.
- The exact duration of impact-generated hydrothermal systems remains a topic of ongoing study and debate. Early studies of small to midsized craters, such as the 4 km diameter Kärdla and 23 km diameter Haughton structures, suggested that such systems would last thousands to tens of thousands of years (Jõeleht et al., 2005; Parnell et al., 2005). Cooling in these small to midsized structures is relatively rapid due to mainly convective heat transport (Kirsimäe and Osinski, 2012). However, recent high-precision age dating of the 23 km diameter Lappajärvi impact structure, Finland, suggests that post-impact cooling and hydrothermal circulation may have persisted for over 1 million years (Schmieder and Jourdan, 2013; Kenny et al., 2019). For larger craters, numerical modelling and age dating of the hydrothermal systems in the ∼250 km diameter Sudbury and ∼200 km diameter Chicxulub structures yield durations on the order of 1 to 2 million years (Ames et al., 1998; Abramov and Kring, 2004, 2007).
- these transient hydrothermal systems can provide the substrates (see Section 3) and habitats (see Section 4) necessary to support the origins and early evolution of life.
- After the cessation of hydrothermal activity, crater lakes may persist, albeit periodically, throughout geological time, providing relatively stable habitats that can persist for as long as the topographic expression of the crater is retained. On Earth today, lakes in craters such as Manicouagan and West and East Clearwater attest to the potential for these features to persist over hundreds of millions of years, although the biota that inhabit the lakes will experience turnover and change in diversity as climatic conditions within which the crater resides change over time.
- the craters that are known on Earth can influence their local ecologies for millions of years and potentially up to billions of years. Indeed, often ecological anomalies provide the first indication of the presence of impact structures (Cockell and Lee, 2002). Thus, although many impact craters are eventually destroyed, it is clear that even on the geologically dynamic Earth, these structures can influence their associated biota over planetary lifetimes.
- impacts can deliver and/or generate many of the chemical ingredients required for life. We also note, but do not discuss here, the idea that large impacts may have played a role in delivering N2, CO2, and other gasses, that may have provided much of the greenhouse warming needed to offset the faint young Sun, thereby improving the overall habitability of Hadean Earth. Essentially, the hypothesis is that volatile-rich asteroids and comets would have released a large fraction of their volatiles directly into the atmosphere when they impacted Earth (e.g., see Kasting, 1990, 2004).
- It has long been suggested that during the early history of Earth, asteroids and comets may have been responsible for the delivery of intact organic molecules and volatiles to early Earth (e.g., Chyba, 1990; Delsemme, 1991; Chyba and Sagan, 1992; Brack and Pillinger, 1998). Chyba and Sagan (1992) proposed that the four main extraterrestrial sources for organic molecules on Earth are interplanetary dust particles, airbursts, meteorites, and cometary impacts. Interplanetary dust particles (IDPS), also known as micrometeorites, are the dominant present-day source of extraterrestrial organic matter to Earth. These ∼5–500 μm sized particles contain an average of ∼12 wt % C (Thomas et al., 1993) and comprise a range of organic material, including aromatic and aliphatic compounds, as well as other mineral phases
- The third important extraterrestrial source for organics is meteorites (i.e., objects that are large enough to survive passage through Earth's atmosphere but small enough to not form hypervelocity impact craters). Meteorites can be classified into three main groups (Lauretta and McSween, 2006): stony—with two major subgroups, chondrites and achondrites—iron, and stony-iron meteorites. Carbonaceous chondrites are one of the three major classes of chondrites and, as their name implies, contain variable amounts of organic molecules. They comprise ∼5% of meteorite falls. The organic inventory of the Murchison meteorite, a CM2 carbonaceous chondrite that fell in Australia in 1969, represents the most thoroughly studied object of this type due to the available mass (∼100 kg) and minor terrestrial contamination. Over a dozen amino acids have been detected in Murchison, including glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid (e.g., Kvenvolden et al., 1970; Pizzarello and Cronin, 1998; Pizzarello et al., 2003). If we consider all meteorite classes, a total of approximately 80 amino acids have been reported (see Burton et al., 2012, for a review). In a recent study, Furukawa et al. (2019) provided the most conclusive evidence to date for the presence of extraterrestrial ribose and other bioessential sugars in Murchison and two other carbonaceous chondrites. The availability of a large amount of carbonaceous chondrite material has resulted in a large number of origin-of-life experiments
- Another group of meteorites pertinent to the geobiological perspective are iron meteorites, representing ∼6% of meteorite falls (Lauretta and McSween, 2006). Iron meteorites are comprised of >95% Fe and Ni. As discussed by Sleep (2018), Fe and Ni metal are out of equilibrium with water and on Hadean Earth would have reacted to generate hydrogen and produced reducing microenvironments. It has also been shown that iron meteorites are readily used by iron-oxidizing bacteria as a source of energy (González-Toril et al., 2005).
- By their very existence, the presence of meteorites means that the organic materials contained within them survived passage through Earth's atmosphere and the low-energy impact with Earth's surface intact, with the exception being the outer few millimeters that is melted to form a fusion crust (Scott, 2011). In relatively small impacts producing simple craters up to ∼2 km in diameter, it is also well known that fragments of the projectile survive largely intact as meteorites and are distributed within the host crater and around it in ejecta deposits
- To date, of all known Solar System objects, comets have the largest organic inventory and likely contributed substantially to the organic inventory of early Earth (Ehrenfreund and Charnley, 2000; Despois and Cottin, 2005). Various remote observations and in situ missions over the past several years have built up a more complete picture of comet compositions. Early studies of Comet Halley in 1986 found that dust particles from the nucleus were ∼14% organic carbon by mass (Ehrenfreund and Charnley, 2000). Later studies of comets Hyakutake (1996) and Hale-Bopp (1997) revealed the presence of over two dozen biologically relevant organic molecules including ammonia, methane, acetylene, acetonitrile, hydrogen isocyanide, formic acid, isocyanic acid, cyanoacetylene, formamide, and thioformaldehyde (e.g., Biver et al., 1997; Lis et al., 1997). More recently, the Rosetta spacecraft performed the most detailed study of a comet to date (comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko). Phosphorus and a rich inventory of organic molecules, including methyl cyanate, acetone, propionaldehyde, and acetamide, were detected on the surface (Goesmann et al., 2015) and glycine, methylamine, and ethylamine were detected in the coma (Altwegg et al., 2016). But surely such organic phases would not survive hypervelocity impacts?
- Several workers have conducted experiments to investigate the survivability of organics and other bioessential materials during impact. In short, a large number of experiments conducted over a range of shock pressures up to ∼40 GPa have shown that a large fraction of amino acids and organic molecule biomarkers can survive hypervelocity impact (e.g., Blank et al., 2001; Bowden et al., 2009; Parnell et al., 2010a). Scaling up energy several orders of magnitude, in a series of numerical modelling studies Pierazzo and Chyba (1999, 2002) indicated that amino acids would survive the shock heating during the impact of kilometer-sized comets.
- In addition to organics, comets have also been shown to contain substantial amounts of the light elements important for life: C, H, O, and N dominate 30% of cometary grains (Irvine et al., 2000). As we noted at the beginning of this section, large impacts would have delivered N2, CO2, and other gasses, that may have contributed to the greenhouse warming needed to offset the faint young Sun, thereby improving the overall habitability of Hadean Earth.
- In addition to comets and asteroids delivering intact molecules, Chyba and Sagan (1992) proposed that organics could also be derived from atmospheric heating due to fast-expanding vapor plumes and via the post-impact recombination of simple organic components. Several studies have shown that amino acids can be synthesized due to atmospheric shock heating in primitive atmospheres (e.g., Bar-Nun et al., 1970; Bar-Nun and Shaviv, 1975). Cyanides are considered to be among the most important compounds for the generation of prebiotic molecules (e.g., Ferris and Hagan, 1984; Orgel, 2004): studies have shown that concentrated solutions of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can form nucleic acid bases and that mixtures of HCN with carbon compounds can produce amino acids (Ferris and Hagan, 1984). Work by Miller (1953) and Zahnle (1986) used lightning and ultraviolet radiation to drive the chemical generation of HCN; however, these products are quickly destroyed and were not able to be effectively concentrated. Kurosawa et al. (2013) showed that HCN formation in meteorite impacts during the LHB could have provided an excellent mechanism for the production and concentration of cyanides, a hypothesis recently supported by the numerical modeling of Devon et al. (2018). A portion of the organic molecules delivered from meteorites and cometary material thermally decomposes in the atmosphere and, reacting with the atmospheric N2, can then form CN radicals. Kurosawa et al. (2013) showed that after a small impact (<1 km in diameter) the density of HCN created is approximately 10 mol/m2 over a 100 km2 surface area, equivalent to between 500 and 10,000 years of HCN generation via lighting.
- During the Hadean, when impact events of this size and larger were frequent, the amount of HCN generated through impacts would have been significant (Devon et al., 2018) and could have been concentrated to a level allowing for the synthesis of some amino acids (Patel et al., 2015). Importantly, Patel et al. (2015) also showed that HCN was an important precursor, not only to amino acid synthesis but to the synthesis of RNA, wherein the production of atmospheric HCN could result in the generation of ferrocyanide and phosphate salts, which then rain down on the surface and are concentrated through evaporation. This evaporative process, along with the presence of ultraviolet light, is a necessary step in the chemical pathway leading to the abiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides, and thus far remains the only known prebiotic formation of ribonucleotides in a single chemical synthesis step (Patel et al., 2015; Pressman et al., 2015).
- In addition to the generation of necessary prebiotic chemical precursors, there is growing recognition that minerals may have played a role in both the formation of simple organic molecules such as formaldehyde and, possibly, in the formation of molecules as complex as RNA, through reactions mediated by minerals, in particular clays (Brack, 2006). Ferris (2006, 2005) showed that the clay mineral montmorillonite is able to catalyze a variety of organic reactions, in particular the formation of RNA, and Fraser et al. (2011) suggested that the interlayer space in clays leads to the formation both of RNA oligomers and the selection of left-handed amino acids. It has also been hypothesized that clays could act as initial templates for the earliest self-replicating molecules (Cairns-Smith, 1966; Ponnamperuma et al., 1982; Brack, 2006). Importantly, clays are ubiquitous products of meteorite impact events on Earth, being generated during the hydrothermal phase (Naumov, 2005; Osinski et al., 2013)
- Cockell (2006) suggested that because of the indiscriminate location of impact events in all lithologies and events of different sizes, leading to hydrothermal systems of different longevities and characterized by different geochemistry, impact craters offer the possibility of a large number of “experiments” in the origin of life, in comparison to, for example, volcanic hydrothermal systems. Specifically, conditions that might be conducive to origin-of-life scenarios are (1) production of diverse clays, zeolites, and mobilization of sulfides and other mineral catalytic and concentrating surfaces; (2) generation of vast mineral surface areas from impact fracturing and metamorphism that aid in catalysis and polymerization; (3) alkaline pH conditions; and (4) differential cooling regimes that in general move from high-temperature systems conducive to organic syntheses to cooler regimes conducive to complexification (Cockell, 2006).
In addition to clay minerals as substrates, shocked crystalline rocks may also have provided a form of concentration mechanism for the origins of life (Cockell, 2004). As described above, such rocks, when exposed to very high pressures, become highly porous and have a high surface area to volume ratio and can have densities lower than that of water, thus being similar to pumice—which can float and form aggregate rafts of material. Brasier et al. (2011) argued that such pumice rafts might have had a role in the origins of life. Here we suggest that the glassy material that comprises highly shocked rocks (similar to pumice) weathers into clays that can then adsorb metals, organics, and phosphates, providing both a reactive surface for prebiotic chemistry as well as an effective method for concentration of putative prebiotic molecules.
-  The key argument is that the formation of a meteorite impact crater results in the production of a habitat (or habitats) that was not present before the impact but that then can be viewed as being beneficial from a biological standpoint. The three major habitats generated by impact events are impact-generated hydrothermal systems, lithophytic habitats (both near surface and deep subsurface), and impact crater lakes
-  Impact melt-bearing impactites within the crater interior are typically both the major heat source for hydrothermal activity and the focus for most alteration
-  Impact cratering thus provides a mechanism to fracture and fault planetary crusts down to several kilometers' depth. Perhaps as important is that these faults are connected to the surface, providing a pathway to connect the previously described hydrothermal, lithophytic, and crater lake habitats with the deep subsurface. Indeed, the vast majority of microorganisms in the subsurface are substrate-attached outnumbering pelagic or free-living cells by 1–3 orders of magnitude (McMahon and Parnell, 2014). The significance of substrate attachment underscores the importance of rock surface area and physicochemical characteristics highlighting the role that both impact-induced fracturing and shock metamorphism play in creating subsurface habitats.
- although impacts will sterilize the immediate area during the event itself, the fracturing caused by impact can yield enhanced habitat for microorganisms over the long term.
- In the end, we may never know what environment on Earth life originated in, but we propose that meteorite impact craters offer all the necessary ingredients, substrates, and environments suitable for the emergence of life, and do so at a high rate of incidence. Indeed, as discussed above, from submarine hydrothermal vents to pumice rafts, impact craters represent an underappreciated mechanism to generate the various proposed environments for the origin of life. As has been noted previously by Cockell (2006) and further demonstrated here, impact craters could be considered a literal application of Darwin's “warm little pond.” Craters offer the added benefit of potentially creating all of these environments in close proximity, essentially representing an “origins” diversity hot spot. Furthermore, due to the inherent dynamic nature of the impact cratering process, the key ingredients for life and even the habitats themselves would have been mixed and dispersed over large areas of Earth's surface. Finally, unlike plate tectonics—which has substantial implications for the nature of volcanism on early Earth—we know that impact events were ubiquitous during the Hadean, thus reducing the necessity to rely on speculation as to the geological processes active on early Earth. Even if life did not originate in an impact crater or with building blocks provided by impact events, we propose that impact craters would have provided protected niches where life may have survived and eventually thrived during the Hadean and into the early Archean.
- From the delivery of the building blocks for life, to the generation of substrates suitable for prebiotic chemistry, to the creation of a wide range of habitats for early life, we propose that meteorite impact events can significantly enhance habitable conditions on, and within, planetary bodies, inviting a literal application of Darwin's “warm little pond” hypothesis for the origin of life (cf. Cockell, 2006). Impact craters can provide all the previously proposed environments for the origin of life on Earth: subaerial and submarine hydrothermal vents, hydrothermal–sedimentary settings, and impact analogues for volcanic pumice rafts and splash pools. Rather than regard impact events as ephemeral exogenous and destructive components of planetary evolution, our hope is that this review demonstrates that we must regard meteorite impact events as a critical factor when considering the emergence and development of habitable conditions on planetary bodies.

- Une sortie extravéhiculaire, ou activité extravéhiculaire, (désignée parfois par son sigle anglais EVA pour extra-vehicular activity) est une activité réalisée à l'extérieur d'un véhicule spatial par un astronaute revêtu d'une combinaison spatiale. 
> Ce sont les EVA qui ont rendu possible la réparation du télescope spatial Hubble, la construction et la maintenance de l'ISS, ainsi que les marches lunaires des missions Apollo.
- La première EVA a été effectuée par le cosmonaute Alexei Leonov en 1965

- Depuis, plus de 200 astronautes ont effecté des EVA, qui représente plus d'un millier d'heures cumulées passées dans l'espace.

## Records

- Le record de ***la plus longue EVA*** est détenu par Susan Helms et James Voss, qui ont passé 8h56 dans l'espace le 11 Mars 2001.
- Le cosmonaute Anatoly Solovyev a effectué ***le plus grand nombre d'EVA*** (16). Il a passé plus de temps en dehors d'un vaisseau que n'importe quel autre humain (plus de 3 jours cumulés).

## Déroulement typique d'une EVA

- La plupart des EVA se font en équipe de 2, pour des raisons de sécurité.
> Il n'y a eu qu'une seule EVA qui a été réalisée à 3. C'était le 13 Mai 1992, lors de la mission STS-49 qui signait le premier vol de la navette spatiale Endeavour. Elle a été réalisée par Pierre Thuot, Richard Hieb et Thomas Akers, dans le but de capturer et de réparer manuellement un satellite qui ne fonctionnait plus (Intelsat VI-F3).  

As Leonov left the spacecraft, his spacesuit ballooned in the vacuum of space. He had to vent some air from the suit to fit back through the airlock, a risky procedure. As soon as this and other problems arose, television and radio broadcasts of the event ended, which left most on Earth in the dark about Leonov's situation. The world would not learn until much later about the malfunctions that nearly killed him and mission commander Pavel Belyayev.

Gene Cernan performed an arduous two-hour EVA during the Gemini IX-A mission in 1966. No one had yet realized the need for handholds and footholds to stabilize a spacewalking astronaut. The inability to gain leverage exhausted him. Without the stress of gravity, his heart rate became almost deadly—about 200 beats per minute.
Cernan's EVA was fraught with problems, including an inadequate cooling system using air that caused his visor to fog up entirely. Sweat accumulated in the lower half of his spacesuit and amounted to 13 pounds of weight lost over the three-day mission. As a result, astronauts began wearing garments with interwoven tubes to circulate cool water close to their skin.
The event also forced NASA to reevaluate EVA training and operational procedures to develop the knowledge and experience needed for the Apollo Moon landing program.
Bruce McCandless tested the Manned Maneuvering Unit during Space Shuttle mission STS 41-B in 1984. Although the unit had few operational uses, this photo of McCandless as the first human "satellite" became one of the most reproduced of the shuttle program.
Assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station has required nearly 1,000 EVA hours so far. 
An invaluable tool for EVA work is the Canadarm2 on the International Space Station, much like the Canadarms located on each Space Shuttle. 


On the last three Moon missions astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft.

EVAs may be either tethered (the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER), a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.
The Soviet Union/Russia, the United States, Canada, the European Space Agency and China have conducted EVAs.
The first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, who spent 12 minutes and 9 seconds outside the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes' worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his 15.35 m (50.4 ft) tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his space suit ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.[4]
At the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) in diameter and 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking "the bends". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by 1.8 °C (3.2 °F) from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in weightlessness and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the Cold War.[4][5]
The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by Ed White from the second crewed Gemini flight, Gemini IV, for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a 25-foot (7.6 m) umbilical, which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim.[4] However, a defect in the capsule's hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.

On November 13, 1966, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin became the first to successfully work in space without tiring during Gemini XII, the last Gemini mission. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in scuba diving inspired the use of underwater EVA training to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy. 

Apollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden made an EVA on August 5, 1971, on the return trip from the Moon, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the service module. 

China became the third country to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008 during the Shenzhou 7 mission. Chinese astronaut Zhai Zhigang completed a spacewalk wearing the Chinese-developed Feitian space suit, with astronaut Liu Boming wearing the Russian-derived Orlan space suit to help him. Zhai completely exited the craft, while Liu stood by at the airlock, straddling the portal. 


The first EVA by a non-Soviet, non-American was made on December 9, 1988, by Jean-Loup Chrétien of France during a three-week stay on the Mir space station.


Compared to how often an astronaut performs other tasks, spacewalks are relatively rare. They're expensive, time-consuming and most of all dangerous. Astronauts usually operate robotic arms like the Canadian-built robotic arm — known as Canadarm2 — to remotely work in the harsh thermal vacuum of space. Occasionally, though, when robotics just won't do the trick, specially trained astronauts must venture outside of the spaceship to complete the task with human finesse.

Astronauts get their first space-suited glimpse of the ISS not in the vacuum of space, but 40 feet (12 meters) underwater. Years before astronauts ever perform an EVA in space, they begin training in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston — a 6 million gallon (22,700 metric tons) pool housing a submerged replica of the space station. 
An astronaut trains for approximately 7 hours in the pool for every hour they might spend walking in space, according to NASA. Underwater, astronauts practice connecting electrical cables, removing broken equipment and everything else they'll be doing in space, all while learning how to work within the constricting suit.
Most spacewalks are performed in pairs. (So far, there has been only one three-person EVA.) One astronaut is the lead spacewalker, responsible for keeping track of the cadence, safety and completion of the entire jaunt.

Once in orbit, preparation for the spacewalk starts days before the space travelers go out into the void. Astronauts prepare for their ultimate home-improvement project by checking every part of their suit and their tools, making sure they're both assembled and tethered properly.
About 24 hours before the spacewalk, astronauts undergo decompression, the same procedure divers follow when returning from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the water. Inside the space station, air is pressurized to the same degree as it is on Earth at sea level: 14.7 pounds per square inch, or 1 atmosphere. 
But inside a spacesuit it's 4.3 psi, according to NASA, which is about the same pressure experienced at 30,000 feet (9,000 meters) above Earth. Experiencing a rapid drop in pressure from 14.7 to 4.3 psi causes nitrogen bubbles to form in the bloodstream and get stuck, blocking blood flow — a condition known as "the bends" or decompression sickness. To avoid the condition, astronauts camp out the night before in a closet-sized airlock while wearing their space suit so their bodies have time to adjust to the change in pressure.
To perform spacewalks, astronauts don a bulky "Michelin Man" suit known as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), which protects them from solar radiation, debris and extreme temperatures. While partaking in this high-altitude hike, the temperature of the surrounding environment can soar to as hot as 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius) in the sunlight and plummet to minus 250 F (minus 160 C) when the sun is out of sight.
In case of emergency, such as an astronaut losing their tether to the spaceship, the spacesuit comes with a jet pack called SAFER (Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue), which the astronaut controls with a small joystick.
Putting on the suit takes 45 minutes. The suit, which weighs 280 lbs. (130 kilograms) on Earth, is a marshmallowy ensemble of three major layers: The bladder that contains the oxygen, the restraint that provides the structure, and the thermal and micrometeoroid layer that provides protection from the environment. The suit also includes a Maximum Absorption Garment (MAG), which is essentially an adult diaper. After all, an EVA may take as long as 9 hours, and you never know when nature will call in the void of space.
Spacewalks typically last around 6.5 hours but can be extended to 7 or 8 hours, if necessary. 
Svetlana Savitskaya, a Soviet cosmonaut, was the first woman to spacewalk in 1984, nearly 20 years after Leonov floated in the vacuum of space. She and crewmate Vladimir Dzhanibekov spent more than 3 hours spacewalking.
NASA astronaut Kathryn Sullivan became the first American woman to walk in space in October 1984. Sullivan fulfilled her dream of gazing down at planet Earth from the stillness of space: "Carl Sagan writes about the 'Pale Blue Dot' — not my experience," she told Space.com. "I did [see] the vivid blue beach ball."
In February 1995, astronaut Bernard Harris became the first African American to perform a spacewalk. Harris dedicated his pioneering spacewalk "to all African-American achievements," the BBC reported. He also carried the flag of the Navajo Nation into space with him, to pay tribute to diverse cultures and highlight "their plight as the original Americans,"
In 2019, NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir became the first pair of women to carry out a spacewalk together, replacing a failed power controller for the orbiting laboratory.
Bruce McCandless made the first untethered spacewalk as he flew about 300 feet from the shuttle in the first test of the Manned Maneuvering Unit on Feb. 7, 1984.

Assembly of the International Space Station (ISS) would not have been possible without the skilled work of dozens of astronauts and cosmonauts performing intricate tasks in bulky spacesuits in the harsh environment of space. Spacewalks, or extravehicular activities (EVAs), were indispensable to the assembly of ISS and today remain important to the continued maintenance of the world class laboratory in low Earth orbit.
On June 3, 1965, astronaut Edward H. White opened the hatch to the Gemini 4 capsule and, as he floated out of the cabin, became the first American to walk in space. A few weeks earlier, on March 18, Soviet cosmonaut Aleksei A. Leonov took the world’s first spacewalk as he floated out of an airlock attached to his Voskhod 2 spacecraft. Although White’s 36-minute EVA appeared effortless, later spacewalkers in the Gemini Program found accomplishing actual work quite challenging.

Les EVA incluent aussi les sorties sur la surface lunaire des astronautes des missions Apollo

Spacewalks conducted aboard Skylab in the mid-1970s proved the value of spacesuited astronauts to carry out repairs and maintenance of the space station – indeed, the EVA to free Skylab’s jammed solar array played a key role in saving the program. 

Spacewalks during the Space Shuttle era demonstrated that astronauts during EVAs could capture, repair and redeploy satellites, test future refueling of spacecraft and evaluate assembly techniques. From the first EVA during STS-6 in 1983 to the last non-space station related Shuttle EVA during STS-125, the final Hubble Servicing Mission in 2009, astronauts completed 52 spacewalks, 23 of them dedicated to servicing the Hubble Space Telescope in the course of five missions. Cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station made extensive use of EVAs for construction, maintenance and scientific and technology research during 79 spacewalks over the facility’s 15-year orbital lifetime. Mir also hosted the first EVA by a non-Russian crewmember, Jean-Loup Chrétien from France in 1988.

One of the stated objectives of the Shuttle-Mir Program, also known as Phase 1 of ISS, was for the United States and Russia to learn to work together as the two former adversaries prepared to jointly build and operate the space station. One arena where this was clearly demonstrated was in spacewalking. As Phase 1 progressed, astronauts living and working aboard Mir became more involved in the station’s operations, including conducting EVAs. On April 29, 1997, Jerry M. Linenger became the first American astronaut to perform an EVA in a Russian Orlan spacesuit with his Mir 23 commander Vasili V. Tsibliev. C. Michael Foale and David A. Wolfe added to that experience base with their Mir Orlan EVAs later that year. Foale became the first person to perform EVAs in both the US EMU and the Russian Orlan spacesuits. On Oct. 1, 1997, Scott E. Parazynski and Vladimir G. Titov performed the first joint US-Russian EMU EVA during STS-86 while Space Shuttle Atlantis was docked to Mir. Titov was also the first non-American to conduct a Shuttle-based EVA.

23 years passed between Leonov’s first daring venture into open space and the first EVA at ISS, during which time 171 spacewalks were completed in low Earth orbit, on the Moon and in deep space.

Astronauts Jerry L. Ross and James H. Newman conducted the first ISS EVA on Dec. 7, 1988, during the STS-88 mission to connect electrical and data cables between the station’s first two modules, Zarya and Unity. 

During STS-96, the second assembly mission in May 1999, Tamara E. “Tammy” Jernigan became the first of many women to perform an EVA at ISS.

On March 10, 2001, Expedition 2 astronauts James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms conducted a spacewalk during STS-102 that at 8 hours and 56 minutes still stands as the longest EVA in history. 

Philippe Perrin becoming the first astronaut from France to perform an EVA at ISS during the STS-111 mission in June 2002.

Luca S. Parmitano, the first astronaut representing the Italian Space Agency to conduct an EVA at ISS, and his fellow Expedition 36 crewmember Christopher J. Cassidy began US EVA23, their second EVA together, on July 16, 2013, without incident. Forty-four minutes into the EVA, as the two crewmembers worked on their individual tasks at different locations on ISS, Parmitano reported feeling water at the back of his head. Mission Control advised them to halt their activities as they devised a plan of action. Cassidy came to Parmitano’s side to assess the situation, at first believing that a leaking drink bag inside the suit was the source of the water. But as Parmitano indicated that the amount of water was increasing, Mission Control advised them to terminate the EVA, directing Parmitano to head back to the airlock and Cassidy to clean up any tools and then follow his crewmate back to the airlock. As Parmitano began translating back toward the airlock, the water continued to increase, migrating from the back of his head, filling his ears so he had difficulty hearing communications and eventually obscuring his vision and interfering with breathing. He made his way back to the airlock mostly by memory and feel, and after Cassidy joined him inside they repressurized the module. Expedition 36 crewmates Karen L. Nyberg and Fyodor N. Yurchikhin helped Parmitano quickly remove his helmet and towel off the estimated 1 to 1.5 liters of water. Later investigation indicated that contamination on a filter caused blockage in the suit’s water separator. Although Parmitano faced a potentially life-threatening situation, his calm response along with quick decisions by the team in Mission Control resolved the crisis successfully. He later joked during an in-flight press conference that he “experience what it was like to be a goldfish in a fishbowl from the point of view of the goldfish.”

The first human being to walk in space, the Soviet Union’s Alexei Leonov, floated from his Voskhod-2 spacecraft on the morning of March 18, 1965 and spent just 12 minutes afloat. They were, as it turned out, 12 miserable minutes. His body temperature soared from the exertion, pushing him dangerously close to heatstroke. His spacesuit expanded so much in the vacuum it became difficult to move or even re-enter the hatch. The one sound Leonov recalls most from the experience was his own labored breathing. 

Americans were runners-up in the race to walk in space, with Gemini IV’s Ed White performing his EVA more than 10 weeks after Leonov’s. But unlike Leonov, White loved every second of his 23-minute adventure. “I feel like a million dollars,” he exclaimed as he maneuvered around with the aid of a hand-held zip gun. The gun ran out of fuel before the walk ended and one of White’s extra gloves can be seen in the footage floating out of the open cockpit door. Still, when told to come inside he responded, “It’s the saddest moment of my life.”

The astronaut who was destined to become the second man on the moon made a smaller but no less relevant kind of history aboard Gemini 4, when he at last proved that spacewalking could be done efficiently and productively. Aldrin exited his spacecraft three times—twice for stand-up EVAs in which he remained partly inside—and once for more than two hours during a full, tethered walk. He took photographs, studied and mapped stars and picked up a micrometeorite sample collector. His combined 5 hours and 20 minutes of EVA blew the doors off of existing records.

History forgets the paradoxical smallness of the first lunar landing. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were on the lunar surface for just 21 hours and 36 minutes. Their moonwalk—a solid-ground EVA—lasted less than two and a half hours.

February 7, 1984: First Untethered Spacewalk
Since Alexei Leonov first stepped outside, every EVA had included safety tethers to keep the astronauts from floating away. But in 1984, astronaut Bruce McCandless eased himself away from the shuttle Challenger, steering about with the aid of a 300-lb. jetpack known in NASA-speak as the Manned Maneuvering Unit—or MMU. McCandless floated more than the equivalent of a football field away and if he felt any vertigo, he was entitled. Held aloft by nothing but physics, he could look down and see the Earth rolling by at four miles per second.

The Soviets’ early-generation Salyut stations were workhorses of longstanding, but that meant they’d need maintenance if they were to keep on flying. In the summer of 1984, Svetlana Savitskaya and Vladimir Dzhanibekov tested one of the most important repair methods ever, welding and brazing metal samples in the vacuum of space. The experiment worked, the system was proven and Savitskaya, in the process, became the first woman to walk in space.

Dec. 5, 1993: First Hubble Repair Mission
Never was a simple exercise in equipment repair so closely watched as when the shuttle Endeavour made its service call on the nearsighted Hubble Space Telescope. The $2.5 billion orbiting observatory was launched with enormous hoopla and then badly underperformed—thanks to a warped mirror. But Endeavour arrived with a fix in hand, and astronauts Story Musgrave and Jeffrey Hoffman made a record-setting five spacewalks over five days to get the rehab work done. The EVAs were broadcast live to Earth and a global—if selective—audience watch the hypnotically slo-mo space surgery. The scenery was beautiful, the handiwork was delicate, and the payoff—more than 20 years of dazzling images—was well worth the effort.

March 11, 2001: Longest Spacewalk in History
The International Space Station (ISS) is easily one of history’s great assembly projects, with 15 modules, some the size of a bus, snapped together in a dragonfly configuration. When one of those modules has to be relocated to another spot on the spacecraft, the work can be painstaking. That’s what astronauts Susan Helms and James Voss learned when they ventured outside the ISS to prep the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module for a move, and didn’t step back inside for 8 hours and 56 minutes—a record that still stands. That is 5.95 laps around the world—or 148,900 miles logged—and one very big job completed.

The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is a system of regenerative life support hardware that provides clean air and water to the International Space Station (ISS) crew and laboratory animals through artificial means. 

The ECLSS consists of two key components, the Water Recovery System (WRS) and the Oxygen Generation System (OGS). The WRS provides clean water by recycling crewmember urine, cabin humidity condensate, and Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) wastes. The reclaimed water must meet stringent purity standards before it can be utilized to support the crew, laboratory animals, EVA, and payload activities. The WRS consists of a Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and a Water Processor Assembly (WPA). The system was delivered to ISS on STS-126 on November 14, 2008, with the UPA activated on November 20, 2008, and the WPA activated on November 22, 2008.

The OGS produces oxygen for breathing air, as well as replaces oxygen lost as a result of experiment use, airlock depressurization, module leakage, and carbon dioxide venting. 

Prior to the ISS, the life support systems on the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft in the 1960s were designed to be used once and discarded. The U.S. had limited experience with long duration crewed flights with the exception of Skylab, a space station adapted from the third stage of a Saturn V rocket. Skylab consisted of three missions in 1973 and 1974 lasting twenty-eight, fifty-nine, and eighty-four days, respectively. The ECLSS on Skylab featured stored water and oxygen, a regenerable molecular sieve for carbon dioxide and humidity removal, and fire detectors using ultraviolet light detection. Unlike earlier spacecraft, the Space Shuttle was a reusable vehicle. Although it incorporated some advances in its life support system, it still relied heavily on the use of consumables. Systems that relied heavily on consumables limited the time crew could remain in space and required continual, expensive launches of fresh supplies of water, oxygen, and expendable life support equipment.

The International Space Station Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is a life support system that provides or controls atmospheric pressure, fire detection and suppression, oxygen levels, waste management and water supply. The highest priority for the ECLSS is the ISS atmosphere, but the system also collects, processes, and stores waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, shower, toilet, and condensation from the air.

Other by-products of human metabolism, such as methane from flatulence and ammonia from sweat, are removed by activated charcoal filters or by the Trace Contaminant Control System (TCCS).

The Urine Processor Assembly uses a low pressure vacuum distillation process that uses a centrifuge to compensate for the lack of gravity and thus aid in separating liquids and gasses.[6] The Urine Processor Assembly is designed to handle a load of 9 kg/day, corresponding to the needs of a 6-person crew.[3] Although the design called for recovery of 85% of the water content, subsequent experience with calcium sulfate precipitation[4] (in the free-fall conditions present on the ISS, calcium levels in urine are elevated due to bone density loss) has led to a revised operational level of recovering 70% of the water content. 

Several systems are currently used on board the ISS to maintain the spacecraft's atmosphere, which is similar to the Earth's.[7] Normal air pressure on the ISS is 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi); the same as at sea level on Earth. 

Carbon dioxide and trace contaminants are removed by the Air Revitalization System. This is a NASA rack, placed in Tranquility, designed to provide a Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA), a Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly (TCCS) to remove hazardous trace contamination from the atmosphere and a Major Constituent Analyser (MCA) to monitor nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, and water vapour.

The Oxygen Generating System (OGS) is a NASA rack designed to electrolyse water from the Water Recovery System to produce oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is delivered to the cabin atmosphere. The unit is installed in the Destiny module. 

The Advanced Closed Loop System (ACLS) is an ESA rack that converts carbon dioxide into oxygen and water. This is very different from the NASA oxygen-generating rack that is reliant on a steady supply of water from Earth in order to generate oxygen. This water-producing capability will save the need to launch an extra 400 liters of water in cargo resupply per year. 50% of the carbon dioxide that it processes can be converted to oxygen and by itself it can make enough oxygen full-time for 3 astronauts. The other 50% of carbon dioxide is jettisoned from the ISS along with the methane that is created. The ACLS is a great complement to the NASA oxygen-generating rack. The ACLS is a technology demonstrator but if it is successful it will be left onboard the ISS permanently. It was delivered on the Kounotori 7 launch in September 2018 and installed in the Destiny module

Elektron is a Russian Electrolytic Oxygen Generator, which was also used on Mir. It uses electrolysis to produce oxygen. This process splits water molecules reclaimed from other uses on board the station into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis. The oxygen is vented into the cabin and the hydrogen is vented into space. The three Russian Elektron oxygen generators on board the International Space Station have been plagued with problems, frequently forcing the crew to use backup sources 

The 10-tonne spacecraft is carrying ESA’s new Advanced Closed Loop System that will recycle carbon dioxide on the Space Station into oxygen. Currently oxygen on the Space Station is extracted from water that has to be brought from Earth, a costly and limiting drawback. The new system promises to recycle half of the carbon dioxide thereby saving about 400 l of water sent to the Space Station each year.

Sustainable life-support systems are needed for longer missions such as to the lunar gateway that is the next structure to be built by the partners of the International Space Station. The gateway will serve as a staging post for missions to the Moon and even Mars, destinations too far away for regular ferry supplies.                                              
The Advanced Closed Loop System hardware is part of ESA’s goal to create a closed life-support system, including water recovery and food production, to support astronauts in space indefinitely without costly supplies from Earth.
    
MELiSSA
»» We are creating an artificial ecosystem which uses micro-organisms to process the
waste so that we can grow plants. At the bottom is sludge (raw waste) which undergoes
anaerobic (without oxygen) fermentation in darkness. Higher up there’s light
but no oxygen. Higher still there’s oxygen and it’s possible to transform ammonia to
nitrate. At the surface, there’s carbon dioxide, oxygen and light. This is where higher
plants can thrive.
Christophe Lasseur, scientist of the MELiSSA Project team

MELiSSA, aka the Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative, is a project of
the European Space Agency (ESA) and is located at the University of Barcelona in
Catalonia, Spain. The endeavor began in 1988 and has been active ever since [7, 8].
The general model is based on the waste loop cycle of a natural lake ecosystem

In such a system, each output is converted into a new input, thanks to the natural
processes occurring in the lake. These processes take place, thanks to the interaction
of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae. These processes are
replicated in the MELiSSA system

One of the first goals of the endeavor was the identification of bacterial strains,
because each compartment requires specific bacteria for the system to work effectively.
It was a difficult task, as deploying the wrong bacteria could result in imbalances
in the system. Another challenge was genetic evolution. Bear in mind that the
planned LSS will be used for years. In that time, bacteria can evolve in a way that
could change the stability of the system.

Once scientists begin to resolve the problems of growing plants on the ground
inside a terrestrial closed LSS, those experiments must be replicated in space. That
is because, as discussed before, physicochemical and biological processes are
affected in microgravity. Another reason these experiments must be flown in space
is because of the radiation environment. Terrestrial plants are happy living in an
environment that is exposed to just 2 mSv per year, but what happens when these
plants and bacteria are exposed to 80 times that dose? [12] To answer these questions,
the MELiSSA program flew the rotating wall vessel and random positioning
machine on board the ISS.
Ground and Space Demonstration
Following promising results from those experiments, the BIORAT (a misnomer,
because the experiment will fly mice, not rats!) experiment will be flown on ISS.

The BIORAT is a testbed for the engineering principles that will be required for a
full-scale closed LSS. Obviously it makes sense to test such a system on a small
scale first, so the BIORAT will comprise a simple ecosystem that will house small
test animals – mice in this case. The focus of BIORAT will be on two of the loops
in the MELiSSA system: the photosynthetic reactor and the consumer compartment.
In this test, carbon dioxide produced by the mice will be consumed by algae
(Spirulina) in the photosynthetic process, thereby resulting in the production of
oxygen. During the test, variables such as lighting, gas transfer, and oxygen production
will be controlled and growth of Spirulina will be modified using different
light intensities.

The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) for the International
Space Station (ISS) includes some subsystems that are regenerative and some that
are non-regenerative. Since a primary goal is to close the loop on the ECLSS, the
aim has always been to increase the regenerative capabilities of these subsystems.
During the 20 plus years the ISS has been orbiting Earth, there has been a gradual
and steady increase in the closure of these subsystems

As of 2020, the ISS ECLSS is classified as a partially closed LSS with a closure of
93 percent. According to NASA’s website, there is no question of embarking on a
trip to Mars until that number is closer to 98 or 99 percent. But it’s not just a case
of closing the loop. Engineers must also look at ways of enhancing LSS capability
and extending the life of current subsystems.

The ISS International Partners provide various ECLSS components within their
modules, but not every module is fitted with a complete suite of LSS subsystems.

The ACLS (. Fig. 5.14), which is currently operating as a technology test and
demonstrator, represents a significant step forward in regenerative LSS. It can process
40 percent of the water required for producing oxygen from the carbon dioxide
exhaled by the crew

The first life support system designed to support a cosmonaut was that flown on
Yuri Gagarin’s Vostok spacecraft. But this wasn’t the first life support system to
be flown in space. For years preceding Gagarin’s flight, animals had been sent into
space. Before Gagarin’s flight, there was Laika, a mongrel pup, who flew into orbit
on board Sputnik 2. Because of the claustrophobic confines of the Sputnik 2 capsule,
the spacecraft’s crewmember could not be heavier than 7 kilograms. Ten dogs
that met the weight requirements were selected, but Laika was judged the calmest
and most photogenic!
As part of her training, Laika was taught to remain still in increasingly confined
cages in the weeks leading up to the mission. Unfortunately, due to the Soviet
government’s desire for a quick success, Laika’s life support system was not as rigorously
tested as it should have been. She made it to space alive, but she didn’t have
much time to enjoy her time in space. The thermal control system failed, resulting
in Laika expiring from overheating after just 5 hours on orbit.

In these early programs, from Project Mercury to the Space Shuttle, life support
systems were primarily open-loop, with few regenerable systems. But with
the advent of the International Space Station (ISS), design drivers changed
significantly. The ISS would require at least 20 years of continuous operation,
which meant engineers had to try to develop ways of increasing the closure of
the ISS life support system.

- En une phrase : la masse observée du boson de Higgs est de 126 GeV. Pourtant, des corrections quantiques issues des interactions avec d'autres particules du modèle standard prédisent une masse 17 ordres de grandeur plus grande (au niveau de la masse de Planck). C'est le problème de la hiérarchie électrofaible.
- The Higgs boson plays a key role in the Standard Model: it is related to the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces, explains the origin of elementary particle masses
- Higgs—the last piece of the Standard Model
- Hierarchy problem. This is often ‘explained’ by saying that quantum corrections want to make the Higgs much heavier than we need it to be… say, 125-ish GeV. 
- The Higgs has a snowball’s chance in hell of having a mass in that ballpark.
- If you put a glass of water in a really hot place—you expect it to also become really hot, maybe even to off into steam.  It would be really surprising if we put an ice cube in a hot oven and 10 minutes later it had not melted. This is because the ambient thermal energy is expected to be transferred to the ice cube by the energetic air molecules bouncing off it. Sure, it is possible that the air molecules just happen to bounce in a way that doesn’t impart much thermal energy—but that would be ridiculously improbable, as we learn in thermodynamics.
- The Higgs is very similar: we expect its mass to be around 125 GeV (not too far from W and Z masses), but ambient quantum energy wants to make its mass much larger through interactions with virtual particles. While it is possible that the Higgs stays light without any additional help, it’s ridiculously improbable, as we learn from quantum physics.
- the Standard Model really, really wants the Higgs to be around the 100 GeV scale. This is because it needs something to “unitarize longitudinal vector boson scattering.” It needs to have some Higgs-like state accessible at low energies to explain why certain observed particle interactions are well behaved.
- The Hierarchy problem has been the main motivation for new physics at the TeV scale for over two decades. 
- it is possible that the Higgs mass is 125 GeV due to some miraculous almost-cancellation that set it to be in just the right ballpark to unitarize longitudinal vector boson scattering. But such miracles are rare in physics without any a priori explanation. The electron mass is an excellent example. There are some apparent (and somewhat controversial) counter-examples: the cosmological constant problem is a much more severe ‘fine-tuning’ problem which may be explained anthropically rather than through more fundamental principles.
-  What are the possible ways to solve the Hierarchy problem?
- There are two main directions that most people consider:
> * Supersymmetry. Recall in our electron analogy that the solution to the ‘electron mass hierarchy problem’ was that quantum mechanics doubled the number of particles: in addition to the electron, there was also a positron. The virtual electron–positron contributions solved the problem by smearing out the electric charge. Supersymmetry is an analogous idea where once again the set of particles is doubled, and in doing so the loop contributions of one particle to the Higgs are cancelled by the loop contributions of its super-partner. Supersymmetry has deep connections to an extension of space-time symmetry since it relates matter particles to force particles.
> * Compositeness/extra dimensions. The other solution is that maybe our description of physics breaks down much sooner than the Planck scale. In particular, maybe at the TeV scale the Higgs no longer behaves like a scalar particles, but rather as a bound state of two fermions. This is precisely what happens with the mesons: even though the pion is a scalar, there is no pion ‘hierarchy problem’ because as you probe smaller distances, you realize the pion is actually a bound state of two quarks and it starts behaving as such. One of the beautiful developments of theoretical physics in the 1990s and early 2000s was the realization that this is precisely what is being described by theories of extra dimensions through the so-called holographic principle.
- An important feature of nature that puzzles scientists like myself is known as the hierarchy, meaning the vast discrepancy between aspects of the weak nuclear force and gravity. There are several different ways to describe this hierarchy, each emphasizing a different feature of it. Here is one:
- The mass of the smallest possible black hole defines what is known as the Planck Mass. 
-     The masses of the W and Z particles, the force carriers of the weak nuclear force, are about 10,000,000,000,000,000 times smaller than the Planck Mass. Thus there is a huge hierarchy in the mass scales of weak nuclear forces and gravity.
- When faced with such a large number as 10,000,000,000,000,000, ten quadrillion, the question that physicists are naturally led to ask is: where did that number come from? It might have some sort of interesting explanation.
- But while trying to figure out a possible explanation, physicists in the 1970s realized there was actually a serious problem, even a paradox, behind this number. The issue, now called the hierarchy problem, has to do with the size of the non-zero Higgs field, which in turn determines the mass of the W and Z particles.
- The non-zero Higgs field has a size of about 250 GeV, and that gives us the W and Z particles with masses of about 100 GeV. But it turns out that quantum mechanics would lead us to expect that this size of a Higgs field is unstable, something like (warning: imperfect analogy ahead) a vase balanced precariously on the edge of a table. With the physics we know about so far, the tendency of quantum mechanics to jostle — those quantum fluctuations I’ve mentioned elsewhere — would seem to imply that there are two natural values for the Higgs field — in analogy to the two natural places for the vase, firmly placed on the table or smashed on the floor. Naively, the Higgs field should either be zero, or it should be as big as the Planck Energy, 10,000,000,000,000,000 times larger than it is observed to be. Why is it at a value that is non-zero and tiny, a value that seems, at least naively, so unnatural? This is the hierarchy problem.
- Many theoretical physicists have devoted significant fractions of their careers to trying to solve this problem. Some have argued that new particles and new forces are needed (and their theories go by names such as supersymmetry, technicolor , little Higgs, etc.) Some have argued that our understanding of gravity is mistaken and that there are new unknown dimensions (“extra dimensions”) of space that will become apparent to our experiments at the Large Hadron collider in the near future. Others have argued that there is nothing to explain, because of a selection effect: the universe is far larger and far more diverse than the part that we can see, and we live in an apparently unnatural part of the universe mainly because the rest of it is uninhabitable — much the way that although rocky planets are rare in the universe, we live on one because it’s the only place we could have evolved and survived. There may be other solutions to this problem that have not yet been invented.
- Many of these solutions — certainly all the ones with new particles and forces or with new dimensions — predict that new phenomena should be visible at the Large Hadron Collider. 
- By the way, you will often read the hierarchy problem stated as a problem with the Higgs particle mass.  This is incorrect.  The problem is with how big the non-zero Higgs field is.  (For experts — quantum mechanics corrects not the Higgs particle mass but the Higgs mass-squared parameter, changing the Higgs field potential energy and thus the field’s value, making it zero or immense.  That’s a disaster because the W and Z masses are known.  The Higgs mass is unknown, and therefore it could be very large — if the W and Z masses were very large too.  So it is the W and Z masses — and the size of the non-zero Higgs field — that are the problem, both logically and scientifically.)
- Either new particles are keeping the Higgs boson light, or the universe is oddly fine-tuned for our existence. 
- When Victor Weisskopf sat down in the early 1930s to compute the energy of a solitary electron, he had no way of knowing that he’d ultimately discover what is now known as the electroweak hierarchy problem. Revisiting a familiar puzzle from classical electrodynamics – that the energy stored in an electron’s own electric field diverges as the radius of the electron is taken to zero (equivalently, as the energy cutoff of the theory is taken to infinity) – in Dirac’s recently proposed theory of relativistic quantum mechanics, he made a remarkable discovery: the contribution from a new particle in Dirac’s theory, the positron, cancelled the divergence from the electron itself and left a quantum correction to the self-energy that was only logarithmically sensitive to the cutoff. 
-  the coupling between the Higgs boson and other particles of the Standard Model (SM) leads to yet another divergent self-energy, for which the logic of naturalness implied new physics at around the TeV scale. Thus the electroweak hierarchy problem was born – not as a new puzzle unique to the Higgs, but rather the latest application of Weisskopf’s wildly successful logic (albeit one for which the answer is not yet known). 
- History suggested two possibilities. As a scalar, the Higgs could only benefit from the sort of cancellation observed among fermions if there is a symmetry relating bosons and fermions, namely supersymmetry. Alternatively, it could be a light product of compositeness, just as the pions and kaons are light bound states of the strong interactions. These solutions to the hierarchy problem came to dominate expectations for physics beyond the SM, with a sharp target – the TeV scale – motivating successive generations of collider experiments. Indeed, when the physics case for the LHC was first developed in the mid-1980s, it was thought that new particles associated with supersymmetry or compositeness would be much easier to discover than the Higgs itself. But while the Higgs was discovered, no signs of supersymmetry or compositeness were to be found.
- In the meantime, other naturalness problems were brewing. The vacuum energy – Einstein’s infamous cosmological constant – suffers a divergence of its own, and even the finite contributions from the SM are many orders of magnitude larger than the observed value. Although natural expectations for the cosmological constant fail, an entirely different set of logic seems to succeed in its place. To observe a small cosmological constant requires observers, and observers can presumably arise only if gravitationally-bound structures are able to form. As Steven Weinberg and others observed in the 1980s, such anthropic reasoning leads to a prediction that is remarkably close to the value ultimately measured in 1998. To have predictive power, this requires a multitude of possible universes across which the cosmological constant varies; only the ones with sufficiently small values of the cosmological constant produce observers to bear witness.
